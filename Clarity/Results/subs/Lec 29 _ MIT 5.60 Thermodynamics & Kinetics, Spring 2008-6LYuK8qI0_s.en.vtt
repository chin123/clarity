00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.010
PROFESSOR: So, the first thing
that we did is look at a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.490
simple polymer model not too
different from polymer models

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.290
that we've seen before.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.770
That is, models for molecular
configurations.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.090
The difference in the case that
we treated last time,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.470
though, was that instead of
having just a handful of

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.110
possible configurations with
their just, designated

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.860
energies, we had essentially an

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.760
infinite sequence of levels.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.450
All of evenly spaced energy.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.390
And we went through that and
saw what the thermodynamics

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.160
worked out to be.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.420
And also with the high and low
temperature limits of the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.420
thermodynamics turned
out to be.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.830
And the interesting consequence
of that is that

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.300
that particular choice of
configurations and energies

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.170
associated with them maps
exactly onto the vibrational

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.590
levels of an ordinary
molecule.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.450
So, of course, when we do the
statistical mechanics in the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.110
end, everything depends on
the partition function.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.760
Right?

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.910
So we're always writing some
molecular partition function.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:30.430
And we've got a sum over our
energies for all the states.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.270
And so the only input
information we need to know

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.650
is, what are the levels and
what are their energies.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.160
So, although we started
yesterday with a model of

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.110
polymer confirmations, once we
decided what the energies

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.540
were, which was this sequence
of energies starting at zero

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.250
and going with E, and 2E, and
3E, I think we labeled them

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.780
E0, and so on, that's all that
mattered as far as the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.880
statistical mechanics
was concerned.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.540
And so, since we started, We
formulated this by imagining

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.460
different confirmations for a
polymer, but in fact these are

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.830
the vibrational energies
of any molecule too.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.250
Of any vibrational mode.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.970
So the results are very
generally applicable.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.540
And so we saw what the
thermodynamics

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.460
worked out to be.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.580
And what the limiting
cases were.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.210
And a couple of them, that I'll
just review, are, one

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.680
that's very important in lots
of settings, is that the low

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.740
temperature limit when you're
down it basically zero degrees

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:44.540
Kelvin, that's where you've
got kT way down here.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.870
So there's not nearly enough
thermal energy for anything to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.810
get out of even the
lowest level.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.260
And so in that case,
everything is

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.930
in the ground state.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.270
And then the heat capacity,
which is this often a very

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.030
simple thing to measure, you
change the temperature.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.200
And you see that there's
no change in the total

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.010
vibrational energy.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.040
In other words, the limiting
low temperature

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.010
heat capacity is zero.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:15.600
So we saw that for Cv
for vibrations.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.130
And the limit that T goes
to zero was zero.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.810
And that's because we were in
this limit, where everything

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.710
is in the ground state.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.100
Which is to say that u
vibrational energy in that

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.970
limit is zero.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.420
Unlike the case we treated
earlier, where we had a

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.870
limited number of levels.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.600
Because we treated a simple
four-unit polymer with only

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.430
four possible confirmations,
in this case we have

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.810
essentially an infinite
number.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.220
So even in the high temperature
limit, we don't

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.070
have them, there's not a
maximum total energy.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.720
If the temperature keeps
going up, you'll get

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.890
more and more energy.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.210
Because you can keep populating

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.270
higher and higher levels.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.690
But the way that happens
stops changing.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.030
Because the levels are
all evenly spaced.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.840
So if the temperature, instead
of being down here, is

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.350
somewhere up here, now for
sure if we change the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.760
temperature, the energy will
continue to change.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.400
But what we've found is that in
the high temperature limit,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.010
we had the equipartition
of energy result.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:35.460
And that is, u vibrational in
the high temperature limit,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.410
was just, for N molecules,
it was NkT.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.240
1/2 kT for each kinetic energy
degree of freedom.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.590
1/2 kT for each potential energy
degree of freedom.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.680
And since vibrations have each
of those, potential and

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.220
kinetic energy, it's kT for each
molecule, for each degree

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.210
of freedom.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.220
That's an incredibly simple,
useful thing.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.950
That means, if I've got a
molecule in the gas phase and

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.570
it's in the high temperature
limit for translation, I know

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.720
each translational degree of
freedom will contribute for

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.520
each molecule 1/2 kT.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.170
Or 3/2 kT, in all three
dimensions.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.980
So I know the translational
energy of a mole of molecules

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.520
in the gas phase at room
temperature without doing

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.040
anything all.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.640
It's 3/2 NkT.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.740
Rotations, if it's a diatomic
molecule, will be two

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.050
different degrees of freedom.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.740
For rotation.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.920
In two orthogonal planes.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.220
And I'll have 1/2 kT for each.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.750
1/2 NkT for N molecules.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.560
For vibrations, if I'm in a high
temperature limit, then

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.960
it'll be kT for each
vibrational mode.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.700
For molecules, the vibrational
frequencies are usually high,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.580
so that you're not in the
high temperature limit.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.180
But for materials where you
have vibrations, acoustic

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.130
vibrations, those are
low frequency.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.690
You can be in the high
temperature limit.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.840
And easily are.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.210
So the result for energy for
vibrational energy in the high

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.920
temperature limit, was NkT.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.250
And so that means that the heat
capacity in that same

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.530
limit at high temperature was
just Nk, derivative with

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.960
respect to temperature.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.650
Very simple thing to
measure, again.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.360
So that's what we saw last time
in the case of both the

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.360
conformational model that we
treated and the vibrational

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.580
energies of molecules onto which
that same model maps.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.670
Now what I want to do, is
look a little further.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.070
And let me actually write the
partition functions too.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.840
Also an important result was
that the partition function

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.920
itself, q vibrational, in the
high temperature limit, was

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.800
just kT over E0.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.190
Also very simple result.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:10.530
E0 is h nu 0 for vibrational
mode with frequency nu 0.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.410
And of course, given the
partition function you can

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.790
calculate everything.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.190
So in the high temperature
limit we can

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.390
easily calculate things.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.940
In the low temperature limit,
it's just one, right?

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.080
There's only one allowed
possible state in the low

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.540
temperature limit.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.310
Everything is in the ground
state when it's cold enough.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.270
So the sum of our states just
gives us exactly one term

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.020
that's of any reasonable
value.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.010
That is, the term with this
being the lowest energy.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.850
Everything else, the energy
is much bigger than kT.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:45.980
This is a vanishingly
small number then.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:51.660
So just write q, vibrational, in
the low temperature limit,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.210
is just one.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.900
OK, that was the case
for vibration.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.010
And remember, these low
temperature limiting cases,

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.900
that's a common case for nearly
any degree of freedom.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.520
As long as it's quantized.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.670
At some point, you'll
get this situation.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.760
Where the temperature is low
compared to even the lowest

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.850
excited level.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.920
Of course, what'll happen in
the high temperature limit

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.050
might vary, depending
on the structure

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.600
of the energy levels.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.020
In the case of vibrations, it's
like this, it'll turn out

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.500
rotations do the same thing.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.800
But it's not always
as simple as this.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.430
OK, now what I want to do is
just go through the next step

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.030
of what we can treat, given
the statistical

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.310
mechanics that we know.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.800
Which is chemical equilibrium.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.180
Why can't we just calculate
equilibrium constants based on

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.480
what we've seen so far.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.810
If we can calculate the
partition functions for

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.550
molecules, and they undergo
reactions and they're in

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.015
equilibrium, we should
be able to calculate

00:08:54.015 --> 00:08:55.380
the equilibrium constants.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.880
From first principles, just
based on the statistical math

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.630
we've seen so far.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:15.340
So let's try to do that.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.710
So it just means that, again,
just as always, if we know all

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.700
the energy levels and what all
the possible states are,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.700
there's no reason we shouldn't
be able to set our sights on a

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.690
calculation of that sort.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.930
So let's just sketch out what
the levels are going to look

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.830
like for simple chemical
events.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:43.170
So I just want to draw an energy
diagram, here's energy.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.595
And, like we often do with
chemical equilibria, I'm going

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:51.090
to set the zero of energy at the
separated atoms, and I'm

00:09:51.090 --> 00:10:14.000
imagining I've got reactants
and products.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.980
So let's make this
our products.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.790
Then over here we'll have our
reactants and make the

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:32.410
energies different.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.510
Alright.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.150
So there's some amount of
binding energy, right?

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.470
There's a bond dissociation
energy going from the lowest

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.800
available level in each molecule
to the dissociation

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.020
limit where we pulled
the atoms apart.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.900
So now I'm going to draw
vibrational energy levels

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.790
inside the molecule.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.230
Let's imagine, it wouldn't need
to be this, but let's

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.830
imagine it's just diatomic
molecules.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.380
So there's one vibrational
mode in each.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.270
Just the stretching mode.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:06.860
And we've already seen the
levels are evenly spaced.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.730
So there's going to be a bunch
of evenly spaced levels.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.520
Actually, it stopped being quite
evenly spaced once this

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.120
stops being a simple harmonic
oscillator, but for all the

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.970
low lying levels it's pretty
close to that.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.430
So those are the available
levels.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.560
And there's a dissociation
energy.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:36.150
So minus E, and I'll call this
for the products, Ep.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.300
And it's just minus D0
for the products.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.080
Right, in language, terminology

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.990
that we've seen before.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:56.870
And it's the same thing
for the reactants.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.260
And really, if this were more
than a diatomic molecule,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.200
maybe there would be a bunch
of vibrational modes.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.080
But it wouldn't matter.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.110
This would just represent all
the vibrational energies.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:14.090
There's some lowest
state available.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.720
So now we've got the
dissociation

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.530
energy for the reactants.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.580
So those are the energies
it takes to

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.820
separate the molecule.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.840
But those aren't the only states
available to molecules.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.490
Of course, they could have
extra vibrational energy.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.400
They're not always in
their ground states.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.470
And we're going to calculate
partition functions.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.880
In general we would sum over
all the available states.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.890
And then just calculate
the probability of

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.290
being in the state.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.880
One way to look at this, since
if there's chemical

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.860
equilibrium between the
species, it means the

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.440
molecules can interconvert.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.190
What that really means is that
any of the molecule has access

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.670
to any of these states.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.560
Of course, we like to group all
these states over here.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.500
Because they correspond to a
particular chemical structure.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.480
And we like to group these
states over here, because they

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.690
correspond to this different
chemical structure.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.850
From a statistical mechanics
point of view, it's just

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.320
states and levels.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.170
And we could just calculate
the probability of any

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.440
molecule being in any
one of the states.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.690
But it's useful to keep them
separated like this.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.260
So let's do that.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.750
And let's look at the
difference here, the

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.870
difference in dissociation
energy.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.970
Delta D0.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.680
Let's not put a double arrow.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.100
Let's define the sign of it.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:54.990
This way, going from products
to reactants.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.870
OK, now let's just look at how
equilibrium should work.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.670
So now, let's just take
a generic reaction.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:06.760
Little a, our number, our
stoichiometric number, A plus

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:17.170
b, and B goes to c C, d D. And
we know that delta G0 is minus

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.630
RT log of Kp.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.570
And that delta G0 is just the
free energy of the products

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.470
minus the free energy
of the reactants.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:43.030
So it's c times G C0 plus
d G D0 minus a G A0

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.760
minus b G equals B0.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.610
So we need to know the
free energy of

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.820
each one of the species.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.200
And now we know how to calculate
that from first

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.930
principles, through statistical
mechanics.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:05.850
So we know that G
is A plus pV.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:16.300
A is minus kT log of capital
Q. And I'm going to assume

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.310
that we're in the gas phase.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.860
And it's an ideal gas, so I'm
going to replace pV by NkT.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.260
And what's Q?

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.240
Well, we know what Q is.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:43.510
It's q, little q,
to the N power

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:47.280
translational over N factorial.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.430
For atoms, this is
all it would be.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.570
But we have molecules.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.920
So we have individual other
degrees of freedom besides

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.320
translation.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:04.040
So let me just label those
internal, q internal.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.300
And that's also to
the N power.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.860
And q internal, if you say,
what are those degrees of

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.580
freedom, well it's the
electronic energy. it's the

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.860
vibrational energy.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.700
It's the rotational energy.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.940
And we'll deal with those
shortly, but let's just

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.720
separate it this way for now.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:26.890
Just we can keep track of where
the N factorial belongs.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.990
And now we're going to use
Stirling's approximation for

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.090
the N factorial.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:46.460
So our log of Q, which we need
up here, is just N log of q

00:16:46.460 --> 00:17:05.210
trans q internal minus
log of N factorial.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:15.790
And that's just equal to N log
q trans q internal, minus N

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:24.170
log N. Plus N. And of course,
this I'm going to put down

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.570
here momentarily.

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:31.810
And now our expression
for G is up there.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:36.510
So it's minus kT log
of Q plus NkT.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:47.190
So these factors of N
are going to cancel.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.800
So when I take minus kT log of
Q, that's going to be minus

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.290
NkT over here.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.780
That's going to cancel
the plus NkT here.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.660
So all I'm going to have left
is this term and this term.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.950
Which I can combine.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:14.520
So it's just minus NkT log of
q translational q internal

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.910
over N. Now these, really, are
just the same as q, it's just

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:26.140
minus NkT log of little q over
N. I didn't need to separate

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.130
that into this product.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.490
I only wanted to do it to be
clear where we were getting

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.770
this factor of N
factorial from.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:39.030
So now we have an expression
for G. And if we know G for

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.590
all the species involved in a
chemical reaction, we should

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.730
be able to calculate the
chemical equilibrium.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.770
So let's do it.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.320
So now to do it, let's look a
little more closely at what

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.330
these internal degrees
of freedom are.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.880
Because that's where these
important details are

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.790
going to come in.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.750
Obviously the equilibrium is
going to depend on the

00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:59.610
energetics.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.610
How much different are the
bonding energies or the

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.450
dissociation energies and
the molecules involved.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.200
And also, how much different
or the other

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.300
molecular energy levels.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.710
The vibrations, rotations,
and so forth.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:27.460
So, q internal is the product
of rotational, vibrational,

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.300
and electronic partition
functions.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:35.370
Remember how we saw that if you
can write the energy as a

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.030
sum of energies, then the
partition functions are

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.690
multiplied.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:44.900
Because, of course, if this is
the sum of a rotational plus

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.740
vibrational plus electronic
energy, then of course I can

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.510
just separate out
these things.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.480
These are in the exponent.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.200
I can write it as a product.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.670
Same with translations.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:01.440
I already have separated that.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.370
So now let's look at how
these things behave.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:13.190
Well, for the electronic case,
there's really only one

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.630
electronic state of interest
in general.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.250
And that's the lowest state.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.810
In cases you're extremely
familiar with, if it were the

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.640
hydrogen atom, it would be
down in the 1s orbital.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.550
And it would take a huge amount
of energy to get up

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.930
into the 2s or 2p orbital.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.810
At ordinary temperatures
you never have that.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.620
All the atoms would be
in the ground state.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.150
Now, for most molecules, it
don't take as much energy as

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.790
for the hydrogen atom.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.300
If you have benzene, for
example, the ground electronic

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.700
state, the lowest electronic
state, is quite far below the

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.990
first excited state.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.130
Not as much as the hydrogen atom
going from 1s to 2s to

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.890
2p, but still by much more than
ordinary thermal energies

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.400
at room temperature.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.900
And what that means is, again,
only the ground state term is

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.570
going to matter.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.350
Now, sometimes we would
define that is this

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.090
as the zero of energy.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.690
But since we're doing chemical
equilibria, the zero of energy

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.670
is up here.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:18.460
So that epsilon, that energy
term, is this amount.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.280
The dissociation energy.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.440
This is minus dissociation
energy.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.940
So we're going to have a
positive number there.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:37.590
So q electronic is just
e to the D0 over kT.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:22:13.880
So that's easy enough.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.280
We also know what
the vibrational

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.300
partition function is.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.130
We saw it last time.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:24.200
It's this thing we could
write as a simple form.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.080
One over one minus e to the
minus E, I'll call it

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.750
E vibe, over kT.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:41.590
It's h nu 0, where nu is the
vibrational frequency.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.040
Again, in the case of many
molecules, the vibrational

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.090
energy is pretty high
compared to kT.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.830
So even this often simplifies
to be just one.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.270
In other words, all the
molecules, in many cases, are

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.160
basically all of them are in the
ground vibrational state

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.830
at room temperature.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.280
Certainly if you look at
molecules of high frequencies,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.860
if you look at the hydrogen
molecule, H2, the vibrational

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.750
frequency is about 4,000
wave numbers.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.590
Remember I mentioned last time,
kT at room temperature,

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.620
T is 300 Kelvin.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.270
Then kT corresponds to
200 wave numbers.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.010
It's a factor of 2/3.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.170
Much less than 4,000
wave numbers.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.130
In other words, the vibrational
energy is much

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.280
lower than kT.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.820
So, again, everything would
be in the lowest level.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.180
And this just simplifies
to one.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:40.630
In many cases, it's reasonably
close to one.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:54.130
For high vibrational
frequencies, nu 0.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:24:03.440
Now, we haven't talked
about rotation.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.430
But you probably have just an
intuitive feeling that at

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.490
ordinary temperatures, if I do
this, if I wave my hand in the

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.670
air, molecules that I happen
to intersect are going to

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.740
start spinning faster.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.750
In other words, ordinary thermal
energies do populate

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:26.300
some number of rotational
levels of molecules.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.490
Molecules probably aren't
going to start getting

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.830
squished together and vibrate
harder when I do

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.390
something like this.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.400
So molecules might generally
still be in the ground

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.610
vibrational levels, thermal
energy isn't enough to raise

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.070
them in many cases.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.920
But rotation, for sure.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.680
They're not all in
the lowest level.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:51.180
Turns out that, in fact, the
energy separation between

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.780
rotational levels is very small
compared to kT at room

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.660
temperature.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.090
So just like we saw for the
high temperature limit for

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:10.500
vibrations, it turns out that
for q rotation in the high

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.760
temperature limit, we have the
same situation where we have

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:23.430
kT over, now it's a
rotational energy.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.970
And it's typically on the order
of about one to ten wave

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:32.400
numbers for small to medium
sized molecules.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.820
Remember, too, last time when
we talked about in the

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.940
vibrational levels and said,
well, if you're at kT and it's

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.440
this big, it's basically telling
you roughly how many

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.120
levels do you have thermal
access to.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.540
Because we saw the same results
for vibrations.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.250
It's not so different
for rotation.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.560
And it turns out that at
ordinary temperatures, you

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.930
might have access to a few
tens to a few hundreds of

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:02.035
rotational levels, depending on
whether they're closer to

00:26:02.035 --> 00:26:03.950
one or ten wave numbers
or a little higher.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:08.830
Again, room temperature
is 200 wave numbers.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:13.400
So, that means that, remember
q is a unitless number.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.920
You're counting the states,
weighted by the energy.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.290
Weighted by the Boltzmann
factor.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:22.070
And for rotations, it's a number
that might be on the

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:34.320
order of 100 or so.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.520
Order of magnitude estimate,
that's all.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:44.130
And of course we've seen the
translational partition

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:54.530
function is on the order of
10 to the 30th, right?

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.890
Enormous number.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.450
In other words, in the simple
lattice model that we've use

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.390
to describe translation, just
breaking up the available

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.350
volume into little pieces.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.930
Counting.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.170
Well, OK, you have something on
the order of 10 to the 30th

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.920
possible locations.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.370
And if you treat this
properly, quantum

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.310
mechanically, for the
translations, there's actually

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:19.850
a magnitude of the number
is similar.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:23.640
Now I just want to go through
a very simple example.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.760
Just treating a particular
generic reaction.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.760
And look at what the equilibrium
constant is.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.620
Working it through, given
what we've seen so far.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.880
So I just want to simplify
it by having all the

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.840
stoichiometric coefficients
equal to one.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.730
It's not a great complication,
if we don't do that.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:50.050
But it's a little bit simpler.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:56.860
So let's take a molecule that's
A-B plus C-D. And now

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.740
let's break bonds
and reform them.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:05.950
So we get A-C plus B-D, right?

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.640
So we're going to do
something simple.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.560
And since I've got all the
stoichiometric coefficients

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.860
equal to one, we've got the same
number of molecules as

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.810
reactants and products, that'll
make things a little

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.060
bit easier.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.770
Just in the sense that if we
look at the contribution of

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.380
the translational energies at
room temperature, they're

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.120
going to be the same.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.420
For the reactants and
the products.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.600
Any of the molecules is going
to have a translational

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.320
partition function on the order
of 10 to the 30th, at

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.710
room temperature and
an ordinary volume.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:40.550
And nothing's going to change
from reactants to products.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:45.490
And for vibrations, let's
assume, as is often the case,

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:48.710
that the vibrational frequencies
are fairly high.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.140
So all the partition functions
for the vibrations

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.100
are equal to one.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.270
Like we've got written
up there.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.330
For all four of the molecules.

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.150
So then nothing is going to
change in the vibrations.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:03.400
Going from reactants
to products.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.720
Finally, the rotations.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.130
So, for the rotations our
partition function is

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:13.320
something on the order of, I
think I meant to write 100,

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.910
not ten here.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.040
As our order of magnitude.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:17.950
That's what it's going to be.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:21.640
It's a number on that order.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.130
And if we assume that the masses
of the atoms involved

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.550
are comparable, then we can
cheat a little bit and say

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:32.290
that's also, those numbers are
also, going to be comparable

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.250
for the reactants and
the products.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.760
We don't have to do that.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.950
We could put it in, and rather
easily calculate it.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.940
But I'm going to make life
simple in this way and just

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.620
work through how to carry
through the calculation.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:51.480
And I think it'll be clear how
to put in different partition

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.700
functions for those quantities
if they are different from

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.000
each other.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:03.920
OK, so let's try it.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:16.520
Then, our delta G0, let's
go back over here.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:23.160
Here's delta G, let me just
put the relationship up.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.070
So we've got an expression for
G. Which is, let's start from

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.690
back there.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:35.690
It's minus.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:40.570
And now for each one of the
substances, it's Ni

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:47.290
kT log qi over Ni.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.950
I'm just going to put
this in molar terms.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:55.110
So it's minus little ni RT.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:31:00.240
Log of qi over capital Ni.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.300
And I only want to do that
because I want to express this

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.150
in free energy.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.840
This is for substance i.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.420
Free energy per mole.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:15.190
So it's just minus RT
log of qi over Ni.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.560
That's G per mole.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:25.240
That's Gi naught per mole.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:30.880
Plus RT log pi over p0.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.010
Where p0 is an atmosphere,
basically.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:39.150
One bar.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:45.820
So that means Gi0
bar is minus RT.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.960
And I'm going to take this minus
this and combine them.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:57.740
So it's log of qi over
Ni, that's this part.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.080
And now I've got log of pi over
p, and I'm just going to

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.730
use the ideal gas law.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.440
So I'm going to use pV is nRT.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:15.920
So then I've got Ni kT
over my factor of

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:23.350
p0, times the volume.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:30.780
So that's Gi0 for each one
of the substances.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.110
The Ni's cancel.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:47.740
And I've got minus RT log of qi
kT over p0 times V. Now, qi

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.460
is just the total molecular
partition function.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.310
It's this product of q trans
times q rotational times q

00:32:55.310 --> 00:33:00.020
vibrational times
q electronic.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:16.370
And now I need delta G. So delta
G0, is just minus RT.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.660
And now it's just, I'm going to
take this for each one of

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.450
the substances, for the
products, minus the reactants.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.010
And I'm going to combine
the log terms.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:25.160
This is the same, and
I'm going to have

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.430
this in every term.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:27.410
So what's going to happen?

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:32.440
Well, all this stuff
is going to cancel.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.320
Now, that doesn't necessarily
happen.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.550
That happens because of
the stoichiometric

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:37.640
numbers being the same.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.120
Otherwise I'd have to take them
to that the power of the

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.880
stoichiometric number.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.920
But in this case they're just
going to simply cancel.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:53.360
So I'm going to have left is
the ratio of my partition

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.870
function for molecule AC.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:00.480
Partition function
for molecule BD.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.830
Partition function for
molecule AB, and

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:07.760
for molecule CD.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.680
Products, reactants.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.040
Pretty simple, because
I know how to

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.460
calculate all this stuff.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.400
And again I'd suggested some
simplifying assumptions for

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.990
what those partition
functions are.

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:23.850
But it wouldn't be hard to
calculate each one of them if

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.150
I just had all the relevant
energy levels.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.070
To make this simple, we're
going to assume that the

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:33.420
rotational energies are the same
for all the molecules.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.640
It wouldn't need to be, it
wouldn't be hard, to plug in

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.880
different values.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.440
We're going to assume we're in
the low temperature limit for

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.310
vibrations.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.570
So q vibrational for
each one of these

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:46.420
things is equal to one.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.240
The translational contributions,
are equal for

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.540
all of them.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:55.420
So the only thing that's
different is the electronic

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.040
contribution.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.980
And that's different.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:03.230
Because, of course, you have
different electronic energies.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.410
The binding energies for the
products and the reactants

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.550
aren't in general going
to be equal.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:13.750
And in most cases, it is the
energetics that dominate the

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.150
equilibrium constants.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:18.480
Of course, that is, it's the
electronic energies that

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.530
usually dominate.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.190
Of course, the other
things do matter.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.420
But it's not unusual for the

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.650
electronic energies to dominate.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:27.830
So here's delta G0.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:33.090
Of course, this is minus
RT log of Kp.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:38.250
So there's our expression for
our equilibrium constants.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.090
So it's just this product.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:44.100
So let's just put in the
partition functions for the

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.540
electronic part.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:53.380
It's e to the D0 over
kT for molecule AC.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:36:11.140
Times e to the D0 for
molecule BD over kT.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:21.530
Divided by e to the D0 for AB
over kT, times e to the D0 for

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:25.030
molecule CD over kT.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:36.240
So the whole thing is just e to
the D0 AC, plus D0 BD minus

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:49.740
D0 AB minus D0 CD over kT.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:57.090
Or in other words, it's e
to the delta D0 over kT.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:00.930
That's the whole story.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:06.620
So it's a super-simple
calculation to execute.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.580
And for lots of molecules,
we know the

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.800
dissociation energies.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.720
These are measured,
determined, either

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.990
thermochemically or
spectroscopically for a great

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.600
many molecules.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.070
So in fact, we have the
information we need to do that

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:21.000
calculation.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.040
And if we want to worry about
the vibrational and rotational

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.310
levels, typically we have
that information, too,

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.360
spectroscopically.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:32.910
So we know what the relevant
energy levels are to do the

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:33.950
whole calculation.

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:37.340
So what it means is, we can
calculate equilibrium

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.980
constants for ordinary chemical
reactions just from

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:42.810
first principles.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.230
Knowing the energy levels
of the available

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:49.560
states of the molecules.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:58.490
Any questions?

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:03.730
In your notes I've included
another example.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.730
It's a little bit of
an extra example.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.110
You can go through
it if you'd like.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:11.560
It turns out to have a kind of

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.280
attractive closed form solution.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.910
Which is the case of a chemical
reaction like an

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:21.200
isomerization inside a
crystalline solid.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.840
So you can imagine you've got
a crystal of some molecule,

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.050
many crystals, thermally over
time, they might decompose.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.360
They might have reaction
processes that can take place.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.240
So I've imagined you've
got uni-molecular

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.930
reactions that can occur.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:34.450
And in that case you
start with a pure

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.040
crystal of one species.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.350
And you end up with a mixture of
some number of the original

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.300
species, and some number
of new species.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.580
And there's an equilibrium
constant that'll say where

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.480
that should be.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.020
So again, it'll depend
on the energies.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.760
On the dissociation energies
of the different species.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.390
And there's also a kind of
mixing term, because

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:59.310
effectively now you've got the
different species located at

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:00.690
different places
in the crystal.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:04.060
Those are distinguishable
states, in the solid.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.790
And you need to count those.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:13.430
But the one other example I
want to work through is a

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.240
little bit different from
chemical equilibria.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.670
It's phase equilibria.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:22.120
Why shouldn't we be able to
calculate phase diagrams?

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.020
So in the earlier part of the
course, you went through and

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.360
saw the macroscopic
thermodynamic treatment.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.470
The equilibrium constants
and chemical equilibria.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:35.980
So of course you saw the whole
delta G0 as minus RT log Kp

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.710
and so forth.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.830
And you've seen now we can
actually calculate all that

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:42.030
from first principles.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.420
What about phase equilibria?

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.830
What you saw before, we just
drew phase diagrams.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.580
And they had boiling points
or lines of boiling.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.360
Or in other words, liquid-solid
and liquid-gas

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.970
and solid-gas equilibria.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:02.410
And what we did is, given where
those lines fell, you

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.260
can calculate things.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.510
But where do the lines fall?

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.440
What's the boiling point or the
sublimation temperature of

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.370
some material at a particular
pressure?

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.450
Well, we didn't offer
any prescription

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.780
for calculating that.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.730
You had to take that from
measurement and then given

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:22.730
that, you could use the
Clausius-Clapeyron equation

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.550
and so forth and look at the
way things behaved if you

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.730
moved along a line in
a phase diagram.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.170
But there was no prescription
offered to calculate where

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:35.350
exactly would that line be
on the phase diagram.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.650
But again, if you know all the
energies of the possible

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:42.820
states, in the solid, in
the liquid and the gas,

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.890
statistical mechanics shows us
that we can calculate the

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:46.960
equilibrium between those.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.990
Which is to say we know
we can calculate

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:51.090
where those lines belong.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:56.330
So I want to just go through
maybe one of a couple of

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:58.400
relatively simple cases.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.450
I want to go through the case of
a solid-solid equilibrium.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.150
Let's imagine we have two
solid phases and an

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:06.770
equilibrium between them.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.320
And this problem was
on the problem set.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.000
How many of you did it?

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.540
Everybody did it.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.330
Did you all get to
the end of it?

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:23.940
Who got to the end of it?

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.510
Some of you got to
the end of it.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:29.310
If you did, congratulations,
it's not so trivial to work on

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:31.160
for the first time.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:36.090
So I'll just briefly go
through that problem.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:37.360
And show how it works.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:42.400
So, it's similar, of
course, to the case

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.810
that we're doing now.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:46.200
To the case we just did,
of chemical equilibria.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.270
The difference, though, is
that it's cooperative.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:56.380
The solid, at least in the way I
formulated that problem, you

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.190
either have the crystal in phase
one or phase alpha, or

00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.960
in phase beta.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.140
And there's nothing
in between.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.830
There are lots of systems
like that.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.880
Not just crystals,
you could go from

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.330
different forms of DNA.

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.230
Act like that.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:15.710
Where you have super coiled
DNA and regular DNA.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.760
And you actually can have
some of the DNA in each.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.510
But it's actually very
cooperative.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:26.170
So there's a huge tendency to
either be all in one, or be

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:26.860
all in the other.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.850
Or at least very very, large
pieces of it like that.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.890
Lots of other systems
act like that.

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.850
In other words, unlike the
case where we're thinking

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:39.030
about chemical equilibrium among
molecules in the gas

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.000
phase, these two molecules
over here crash into each

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.060
other and they react.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.370
Nothing else cares.

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.560
The other whole mole of
molecules does whatever they

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.630
were doing.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.070
And a little later some other
pair of molecules happen to

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.640
crash into each other and maybe
react or maybe don't.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.330
In other words, there's no
cooperativity at all.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:43:00.500
What happens to some pair of
reactants and products,

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.040
everything else is completely
independent of it.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.860
That's not the case when you
have, in many cases, a phase

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.460
transition.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.740
You can see it by eye, often.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:13.060
If you do something like
super cool water.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.380
This is a kind of
fun experiment.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.160
If you take dry ice,
and you've got a

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.020
little bit of water.

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.520
Right or a little
pot of water.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.250
And you put some dry
ice into it.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:26.840
So you can actually get the
water to be below the freezing

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.940
temperature and it
won't freeze yet.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.380
Then you drop a crystal
in there and

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.880
boom, it all freezes.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.790
Very cooperatively.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:38.500
Lots of phase transitions
behave like that.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:52.350
So let's just see
how it works.

00:43:52.350 --> 00:44:04.130
In this case, it's really
similar to what we just did.

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:09.670
We can treat it, here's
phase alpha.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:14.220
Here's phase beta.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:18.900
And the crystal, the
interactions between molecules

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.130
or the atoms in the crystal are

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:21.830
different in the two phases.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.900
So effectively, the binding
energy is different.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.440
In other words, if you say, now
let's think of the energy

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.980
it would take to evaporate all
the atoms or molecules and let

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.040
them loose in the gas phase.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.780
That's the analog of
dissociation for the molecule.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.840
You're pulling everything apart
from the crystal and

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.940
separating them all.

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.030
So that's what we'll call
these energies.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:48.370
This'll be minus E alpha.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:55.950
And this will be minus E beta.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.440
And then there are vibrational
energies.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.740
So the lattice has a bunch
of vibrational energies.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.440
We can assume they're
evenly spaced.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.040
And they're going
to be different.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.460
They're not the same in the two

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.630
different crystalline forms.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:11.810
That's typically the case.

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.090
You have a phase transition from
one crystal to another.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.110
The lattice vibrational
frequencies aren't

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:17.130
the same any more.

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.740
Speed of sound is different.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.660
Things are different.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:21.330
And that's all.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.810
That's the only thing
that's different.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:40.100
So these are binding
energies per atom.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:47.600
So now, let's just try to
calculate Q. And what we are

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.270
supposed to get out of this
is, what's the phase

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.770
transition temperature?

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:55.620
That's the thing that we didn't
have any prescription

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.200
for calculating before.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.930
We just said, here it is.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.060
Here's the boiling point.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.510
Here's the melting point,
or whatever the

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:02.850
phase transition was.

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.620
Or if we drew a phase diagram,
here's the line.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.930
But now we're going to try to
calculate where that is.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:09.720
Or what those temperatures
are.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:16.730
So, Q for either phase it's
just e to the E over kT.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.000
Just like we saw before for the

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.240
dissociation energies of molecules.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.510
To the Nth power.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:23.620
No N factorial any more.

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.580
There's no translation.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.920
Times the vibrational part.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.540
This is the electronic
partition function.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.810
And then there's the
vibrational part.

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:40.690
And that's one over one minus
e to the minus h nu, what's

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:44.560
called E over kT, for the
lattice I'm assuming it's just

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.410
one frequency.

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:53.590
So this energy is h nu E. And of
course, it's different for

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:57.880
the alpha and beta phases.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.950
And I'm going to assume we're in
the high temperature limit.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.800
Which is often the case for
lattice vibrations.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.880
So it's e to the, little
E over kT.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.310
For our electronic part,
to the Nth power.

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.070
And we've seen what the high
temperature limit is.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:15.100
It's kT over h nu E.
And that's also,

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.760
that to the 3N power.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.980
I should have written
this here.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:24.630
In other words if you say, how
many vibrations are there in

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:28.770
the lattice, well if there are
N atoms, each atom in the gas

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:30.420
phase would have three
degrees of freedom.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.310
Translational degrees
of freedom.

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:35.090
In the crystal, it can't
freely translate.

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:36.860
But those degrees of freedom
are still there.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.680
The atoms can all move.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.410
So now, those are the
lattice vibrations.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:42.930
When the atoms try to
move, they vibrate

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.920
against each other.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.580
So how many different
modes are there?

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.650
They may be degenerate.

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:50.550
They may all have
the same energy.

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:52.600
But those modes are
all still there.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.690
Actually, they're the acoustic
modes of the crystal.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.850
And there are 3N of them.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:01.160
One for each translational
degree or freedom

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.990
that each atom had.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:06.060
OK, so that's it.

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:13.210
A, minus kT log of Q,
so it's just minus

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:16.670
NE, and the kT cancels.

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:29.900
Minus 3NkT log of kT over
h nu E. Second part.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:33.810
And then we can calculate
the chemical potential.

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:40.670
It's just the dA/dN,
d constant T and V.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:41.850
So this goes away.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:48.260
It's just minus little E. This
goes away, it's minus 3kT log

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:55.440
of kT over h nu E. Well,
basically we just finished.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.390
At the phase transition
temperature for the two

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:02.350
phases, those things
have to be equal.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:03.550
And that's all there is to it.

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:18.040
So, at, we'll call it Tc, the
phase transition temperature,

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:26.400
I guess I called it T1 here, mu
alpha is equal to mu beta.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.820
So this stuff for alpha is
equal to this for beta.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.540
That's it.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.390
So what does it say?

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:44.320
It says E beta minus E alpha,
these terms, equals 3kT1 log

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:50.650
of nu E beta over nu E alpha.

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:52.520
Solve for T1.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.400
That's it.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:02.760
It's E beta minus E alpha
over 3k log nu E

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.830
beta over nu E alpha.

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:09.220
There is our phase transition
temperature.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.570
That's the whole story.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:15.700
So if we know the electronic
energy that binds the crystal

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.850
together, usually something that
can be measured easily,

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:21.190
so it's known for
many materials.

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.850
And if we know the lattice
vibrational frequency.

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:26.080
Also something that's
pretty routinely

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.110
measured, we're done.

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:34.430
So again, from a very simple
first principles approach, we

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.570
can calculate that phase
transition temperature.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:42.910
We could do it for a solid-gas
equilibria too, if we said OK,

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:45.300
let's think of sublimation
of the solid.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.000
And now we know how to calculate
the chemical

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.380
potential in the gas phase.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.780
We can have those be equal.

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.540
That's actually worked through
in your notes.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.130
Again, it's an extra problem.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:57.410
If you would like to take
a look at it, it's a

00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:59.680
straightforward calculation.

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.470
The point is, we can calculate
those phase equilibria.

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:03.820
Liquids, I will say,
are harder.

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.980
Just because it's harder to
define and know all the

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.480
energies available.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.910
Doable, approximately.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:13.920
But the point is, we can
actually now locate all those

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.040
lines that we sort of
arbitrarily drew

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.910
on the phase diagrams.

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:21.120
And make sense of what the
temperatures and what the

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.220
pressures are, for that matter,
where they occur.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.690
Any questions?
