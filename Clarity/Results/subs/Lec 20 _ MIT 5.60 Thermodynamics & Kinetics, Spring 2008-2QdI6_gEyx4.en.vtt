00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.610
PROFESSOR: Alright, so last time
we started talking about

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.000
more complicated mixtures.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500
To get into colligative
properties.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:41.540
And the example we gave was a
binary system that has two

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.880
components.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.200
And two phases.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.010
So we have a liquid phase
on the bottom.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.470
A gas phase on top, and two
components, A and B, where

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.520
compositions xA and xB are
in the liquid phase.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.810
Those are the mole fractions.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.955
And yA and yB in the gas phase,
the mole fractions in

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:17.290
the gas phase.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.860
And what we did last time was
to begin to say how many

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.410
degrees of freedom do we have,
how many variables do we need

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.220
to completely describe
this mixture.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.940
And it turned out that for this
mixture, we only needed

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.830
two variables.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.910
Two degrees of freedom.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.970
We started out with four
variables; the temperature,

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:48.090
the pressure, and the components
in the composition

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.010
in the liquid phase and the
composition in the gas phase.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.670
We need one of these, either
xA or xB, and one of these,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.900
either yA or yB because
they add up to 1.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.440
So you start with four, but
because you are in a mixture,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.180
an equilibrium, you
have constraints.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.950
You have the chemical potentials
that have to be

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.580
equal to each other.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.170
The chemical potential of A in
the gas phase has to be equal

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.870
to the chemical potential of
A in the liquid phase.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.590
And the chemical potential of
B in the gas phase has to B

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.512
equal to the chemical
potential of B

00:02:21.512 --> 00:02:22.160
in the liquid phase.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.540
So you start with
four variables.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.090
Temperature, pressure, xA, yA,
then you have the constraints

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.890
that mu A, in the liquid phase
has to be equal to mu

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.860
A in the gas phase.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.430
Because you're at equilibrium.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.082
And mu B in the liquid phase
has to be equal to mu

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.790
B in the gas phase.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.580
So four minus two constraints
means you have

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.270
two degrees of freedom.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.440
And so if you want to know
everything about this mixture,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.490
all you need is the temperature

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.570
and the total pressure.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.960
And that's enough.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.017
It's kind of amazing.

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:09.430
Give me the temperature and
pressure and these two

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.390
components, like water and
alcohol, for instance, and I

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.230
can tell you everything about
the compositions.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.410
It's very powerful.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.950
And then we said that this
turned out to be a special

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.290
case, or sub-case of the more
general Gibbs phase rule.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:37.380
where the Gibbs phase rule tells
you that if you have C

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.670
components, in this case here
we have two, and the general

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.900
case of C components with p
phases, the number of degrees

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.730
of freedom is C minus
p plus two.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.050
This is components.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.100
And phases.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.250
And where we're going to start
today is by proving this.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.450
And then we'll do more with
this problem here.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.720
So the first thing is for us
to prove Gibbs' phase rule.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.190
So Gibbs phase rule.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.810
We start out with all the
variables that we have.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.750
And then we add the
constraints.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.480
And for the Gibbs phase rule,
then we start with the two

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.950
knobs that we can
turn externally.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.720
Which are the temperature
and the pressure.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.090
So we start with temperature and
pressure, as two variables

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.550
that we have.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.770
And then we have a
bunch of phases.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.940
We have C phases.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.210
And in each phase we have to
describe the composition in

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.270
that phase.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.850
So, for each phase
alpha, we have to

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.670
describe its mole fraction.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.760
So here we needed to describe
xA for phase A. And yA for

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.790
phase A. For component
A in the gas phase.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.350
So now we have alpha
components.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.860
And for each component we have
to describe its mole fraction

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.400
in that particular phase.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.870
So we have to describe
x sub i.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.040
But we have a constraint
on that.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.240
The constraint is that the sum
of all the mole factions has

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.140
to be equal to one.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.780
That's what it is, to
be a mole fraction.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.745
So the constraint is that x sub
i, i from one to alpha, is

00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:30.510
equal to one.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.530
So the constraint on the number
of the components,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.470
instead of having, actually, i
goes from one to C, because

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.350
that's the number components.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.210
So instead of having C different
compositions that we

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.100
need to take care of, we
only need C minus one.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.530
Just like here we only
needed one, just xA.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.190
We didn't need both xA and xB,
because we knew the sum was

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.310
equal to one.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.320
So that means that we really
need C minus one variables to

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.510
describe the composition
in one of the phases.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.320
But we have p phases,
so let me fix this.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.610
We had C components.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.000
We have p phases.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.170
And so for each phase, we have
to describe the composition.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.850
So that means that we need p
times C minus one variables to

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.450
describe all the components
and all the phases,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.820
plus these extra two.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.390
So the total number variables
then that we start out with

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.990
before putting the fact that
we're in equilibrium, is going

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.250
to be two plus p times
C minus one.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.790
So that's a basic description
of the system.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.220
Then we put in the
same constraints

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.330
that we had up here.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:58.150
In terms of the chemical
potentials.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.570
If I take any of the components,
let's take the

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.240
alpha component, or the
i'th component.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.970
Because it's in equilibrium, the
chemical potential of that

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.350
particular component has to be
the same in all the phases.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.660
So let's take the
i'th component.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:21.510
So yi in phase one has to be
equal to yi in phase two, has

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.720
to be equal to yi in phase
three, has to be equal to yi

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:33.350
in phase p.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.660
All the chemical potentials have
to be the same across all

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.370
the phases for that component.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.220
And if you count the number of
equations, the number of

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.240
equals signs here, that's p
minus one. p minus one equals

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.330
signs, constraints due to
the fact that I have an

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.220
equilibrium here.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:08:03.630
So this gives me p minus
one constraints.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.640
And this is true for every
single component.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.950
Every single component has to
have its chemical potential,

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.240
its chemical potential equal
throughout the phases.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.480
So p minus one's constraint
for one component times C

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.000
components.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.100
So for a total of C times p
minus one total constraints.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.200
My variables, my constraints.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:36.680
So the number of degrees of
freedom then becomes p times C

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:49.180
minus one minus C times p minus
one and then plus two.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.520
And if you multiply this out,
p times C gets rid of the p

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.780
times C here.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.670
And you get the plus
C minus p plus two.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.320
Which is the Gibbs phase
rule, right?

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.630
Which I'm going to bring
back up here.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.020
C minus p plus two.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.750
So just purely in accounting,
just accounting for the

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.510
variables and the constraints.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:23.430
OK, any questions on
how we did this?

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.090
Great.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.710
OK.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:33.240
So let's move on, then, to
these ideal solutions.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.110
Which is this case right here.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.070
And the first thing we're going
to do is look at the

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:47.470
case where we have A is a
solvent, and it's volatile.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.450
And B is a solute, which
is non-volatile.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.520
So let's take the first case.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:00.240
We have A volatile,
that's a solvent.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.700
Could be water.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.440
And B is going to
be the solute.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.880
It's non-volatile.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.750
And let's interchange solute
or non-volatile to be

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.600
consistent here.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.700
So this could be sugar.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:27.250
A sweet water.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:41.050
So, Mr. Raoult looked at such
solutions, and found that they

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:46.470
could be well described by the
following diagram here.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:51.300
So if I plot on the x-axis here,
from zero to one, I'm

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.750
going to plot the partial molar
fraction of the solute.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.010
Partial molar fractions of the
solute, that's going to be xB.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.740
So when xB equals to zero, I
have a pure water solution.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.370
When xB is equal to one,
I have pure sugar.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:17.990
Then on the y axis, I'm going
to plot the total pressure.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.410
So when I have a pure water
solution, the total pressure

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:26.660
is going to be the same as the
vapor pressure of water at a

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.150
particular temperature.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:36.570
Let's take temperature
fixed at some value.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.840
Temperature is fixed
at some value.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.320
I'm going to have the total
pressure is going to be the

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.970
partial pressure of the water.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.290
And clearly, when I don't have
any water left, all I have is

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.390
the sugar, there's
no pressure.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.440
We're going to assume that it's
totally non-volatile.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.000
Obviously there's going to
be a little bit of vapor

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.190
pressure, even at room
temperature.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.980
Ten to the minus, I don't know,
13 torr or something.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.340
But anyway, it's basically
zero here.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.680
And what Raoult said is that
while these two points are

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:13.430
just connected by
a straight line.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:19.800
Simplest way to connect
two points.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:27.370
Basically, he said that the
pressure of, the vapor

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:32.450
pressure of the water in
this case, is equal

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:38.310
to xA times pA star.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:42.680
I could also plot this with xA,
going from one to zero,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:49.430
since xA plus xB is
equal to one.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:56.160
Or I could write this as one
minus xB times pA star.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.890
Where a star, the star,
means pure water.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:06.660
So pure A. And pA is the vapor
pressure of the mixture.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.000
Which in this case here is the
total pressure, because I

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.630
don't have anything else
that's volatile.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:29.240
And this is Raoult's law.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.930
And the first thing that you can
use this for is to look at

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.780
your first colligative property
which is vapor

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:45.900
pressure lowering.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.120
And let me point out another
thing first.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.940
So if a solution obeys that
property here, it's called an

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.230
ideal solution.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.470
So if the water-sugar solution
really did behave like a

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.290
straight line like this, as
you increase the amount of

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.190
sugar, then it would be
an ideal solution.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.270
Many things are very
close to it.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:07.230
It's not such a bad
approximation.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.490
Especially in that
region up here.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.015
Around zero, when the amount
of sugar is pretty small.

00:14:12.015 --> 00:14:19.070
You expect to obey an ideal
solution behavior.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:24.320
Alright, so let's look now at
a glass of water that has

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.150
sugar in it.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.320
We've got my glass
of water, H20.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:34.640
With some sugar dissolved
in it.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:42.260
And it's got a certain vapor
pressure on top. pA, or pH2O.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.590
And I'm going to ask the
question, what's the

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:48.950
difference between the vapor
pressure what it would be

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.370
without the sugar in it.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:59.670
What is pA star minus pA?

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:07.230
Obeys Raoult's law. pA star,
pA is xA pA star,

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.230
plug that in here.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:15.900
That's one minus xA pA star,
one minus xA is xB.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.410
xB pA star.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.010
Well, the first thing I know
is that this is a positive

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.573
number. xB is a positive
number. pA star

00:15:23.573 --> 00:15:25.020
is a positive number.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.500
This is greater than zero.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.050
That means that the act of
putting some solute in my

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:37.540
water decreases the vapor
pressure of the

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.450
water in the gas phase.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.880
Pretty simple.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:47.130
It's called vapor
pressure law.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.550
And we can actually take
this one step further.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:57.510
We can draw a phase diagram.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.990
So our usual phase diagram here
with temperature on this

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.470
axis here and pressure on this
axis here, and we've got our

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:09.390
triple point sitting here.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.280
And our gas-liquid line, with
a critical point here.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.770
So this is gas here, there's
a liquid here.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:21.430
And we've got our, this
is going to be water.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.690
So it's got a negative slope.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.550
I think I've got it
right this time.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.400
And there's the solid
phase here.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.420
OK, this is for the
pure stuff.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:40.770
So now I can draw a similar
diagram for sugared water.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.500
And I just looked at
this, assuming it

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.480
obeys Raoult's law.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:50.870
What we looked at here was the
gas-liquid coexistence.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.350
And we found that the gas-liquid
coexistence point,

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.290
the vapor pressure of
the water, was less

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.740
than if it were pure.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.670
So that means that if I looked
at the gas-liquid coexistence,

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.110
which is this line right here.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.710
In the presence of sugar,
that whole line is

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.620
going to get lowered.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.140
The pressure, the vapor
pressure, of the water is

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.400
going to be lower when
the sugar is there.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:26.770
So the whole thing is
going to get lower.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:32.325
Now, if I have a solid, if the
water is a solid, it's going

00:17:32.325 --> 00:17:34.730
to crystallize the water, the
sugar is going to be separated

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.080
from the water.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.250
The sugar and the water are not
going to really know about

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.700
each other.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.840
They're just going to have big
chunks of pure water, with

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.430
every now and then a molecule
of sugar that's in there.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.680
So you don't really expect to
see any difference between the

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.980
pure solid water, in terms of
the gas-solid interface, and

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.290
the pure liquid water.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.120
There's no sugar in
the gas phase.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.130
And as far as the gas phase is
concerned, that solid phase is

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:11.820
pure water.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.230
It's just seeing pure ice
crystals on the surface.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.400
Every now and then there's
a molecule of sugar.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.970
So you expect this to be
pretty close here.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.850
So you expect the triple
point to go down.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:30.246
And if I now, I go up to the
solid-liquid coexistence, and

00:18:30.246 --> 00:18:34.470
go up like this, I can make a
prediction about solid-liquid

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.950
coexistence.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:42.380
I can predict that if I'm
looking at, let's put one bar

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:49.530
here somewhere.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.050
One bar.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.570
Room temperature, sitting
here somewhere.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.360
One bar, room temperature,
water is all liquid.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:03.720
This is what it would usually,
solid, liquid, that would be

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.510
273 degrees Kelvin.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:10.570
That's the melting
point of water.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:14.090
So now if I put sugar in the
water, and I follow my diagram

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:21.140
here, what I find is that the
new melting point of water is

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:29.850
some new temperature T, T1,
where T1 is less than 273

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:30.094
degrees Kelvin.

00:19:30.094 --> 00:19:31.090
You all know this.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.640
When you put something, like an
impurity, a salt or sugar

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.830
in the water, the melting
point gets depressed.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:43.110
It goes down.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.030
Straight from here.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.820
You can build it up straight
from here.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:51.850
When we get to the colligative
properties, we'll attack it

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:55.740
from the point of chemical
potentials.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.620
We'll equate chemical potentials
and we'll look at

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.990
the change in the chemical
potential in the water, and

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.090
the presence of the sugar and
we'll do it rigorously.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.010
But this is sort of the first
indication that these

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.460
colligative properties are all
connected to each other.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.270
They're connected to
this diagram here.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.360
OK.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.940
So when I was a kid, and I knew
that this was the case.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.380
Everybody knows this
is the case, right?

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.536
You put salt in the water
and you expect all sorts

00:20:24.536 --> 00:20:25.180
of things to happen.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.720
You expect the vapor pressure
to go down.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.273
And certainly you know that you
add salt to the roads and

00:20:31.273 --> 00:20:33.620
the water melts, et cetera.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.850
And my mother always told me
that the reason why you added

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:42.360
salt to the water was so that
the temperature of the water

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.050
would get higher when you
try to boil pasta.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.770
And for, I don't know, fifteen
years I believed her.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.110
Until I taught thermodynamics.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:58.010
And I actually calculated the
change in the temperature by

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:01.020
adding a few pinches of
salt to the water.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.730
And you know how small that
temperature change is?

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.960
You should calculate it.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.880
It's really tiny.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.920
It won't make any difference
for the water.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.370
Probably the difference in the
temperature of the water will

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:16.040
be the same as if I cooked here
versus halfway up Mount

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.460
Washington in New Hampshire
or something.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.220
Probably even less.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.875
There's no difference.

00:21:20.875 --> 00:21:23.820
The reason why you add salt is
so that it tastes better.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.530
That's the only reason.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:28.610
It has nothing to do with
thermodynamics.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:35.730
Alright, any questions
on this?

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.240
So we going to make it a little
bit more complicated

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.090
now, if there's no questions.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:43.070
We're going to now have,
instead of having one

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:47.080
non-volatile solute, use we're
going to have two, we're going

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:47.730
to have this mixture.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:58.580
Where both components
are volatile.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.230
Can we erase this?

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.950
Actually, I may not
erase this.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:12.140
Because I want to keep
Raoult's law here.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:16.000
OK, we're going to have a
mixture of two volatile

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.550
components.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.960
For instance, water
and alcohol.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.510
Your your typical martini
type situation.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.660
Or margarita.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:40.370
Whatever's your favorite
drink.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:47.840
So now we have xA, we have xB,
we have yA, we have yB.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:23:00.430
And we're going to assume that
both obey Raoult's law with

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.590
respect to each other.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:08.100
So now if I draw a diagram,
and I just focus on, so

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.080
there's the total pressure
sitting here.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.500
And I just focus on
one component

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.400
and ignore the other.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.800
Suppose I focus on A. And I know
that A in the presence of

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.590
B, the partial pressure of A is
going to obey Raoult's law.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.563
And let's take A to be the more
volatile component in

00:23:28.563 --> 00:23:30.240
this case here.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.770
So pA star is bigger
than pB star.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.820
The partial pressure, pure A,
had a particular temperature,

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:46.090
T fixed is bigger than pB star,
it's the more volatile

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.490
of the two.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:56.980
So if I were to plot pA as a
function of xB, going from

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.820
zero to one, so it'll be
Raoult's law, I'm going to

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.360
start at pA star.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.680
And I'm going to go down
linearly to xB equals one.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.445
Now I can do the same thing for
the partial pressure of B.

00:24:12.445 --> 00:24:19.100
And assume that in the presence
of A, just looking at

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.200
this component B, now, and I'm
looking at the partial

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.530
pressure of B, and it's got its
impurity in it, A. B obeys

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.450
Raoult's law with A in there.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:34.080
But now if I want to keep the
same x axis here, I can look

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.920
at xA here, going from
zero to one.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.310
So I just basically flip
the thing over.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.950
So at xA equals zero that's
pure B. pB star is

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:45.960
less than pA star.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.780
I'm starting here, on that side
here. pB star, and I'm

00:24:49.780 --> 00:25:00.246
going down in a straight line to
zero. pB is equal to xB pB

00:25:00.246 --> 00:25:02.110
star, straight line all
the way to zero when

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.210
xB is equal to zero.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.180
So that's pB.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.860
And that's pA.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:17.250
Now, the total pressure is the
sum of the two. pA plus pB.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.570
So the total pressure in this
system here, that I measure

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.740
here, is just the sum of these
two straight lines.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.220
Let me do it in blue.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.510
The total pressure, if you add
up these two straight lines

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.320
together, you got another
straight line.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:38.460
Two straight lines make a
straight line. p is pA plus pB

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:48.030
is equal to xA pA star
plus xB pB star.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:54.200
Now, xA and xB are related.
xB is one minus xA.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.080
And so really, this is only a
function of one variable here.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.820
Linearly, with respect
to one variable.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.190
OK, what does this
diagram tell me?

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:13.020
So now, let's ignore
how we built it.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:19.490
And let's take a look at it.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.760
So I have, going to take
xB on the bottom here.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.140
From zero to one.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.120
We could choose either one, and
I've got the straight line

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:36.370
for the total pressure going
from pA star to pB star.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.890
T is fixed.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.360
I need to tell you that T is
fixed because I have two

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.920
degrees of freedom, right?

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.700
I have two degrees of freedom.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.500
My degrees of freedom are the
temperature, which I'm fixing.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.880
And the composition
in the liquid

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.500
phase, which I'm fixing.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:59.850
So my two variables are
xB and T. Those are my

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:00.820
two degrees of freedom.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.330
And I'm telling you what
the total pressure is.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:08.190
I'm giving you total pressure as
a function of xB and T. By

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.510
fixing T, I'm really telling
you what the pressure is of

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.190
the function of xB.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.250
So the Gibbs phase rule then
tells me that the pressure

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:20.300
should be only a function
of xB if T is fixed.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.600
Should be a line.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.980
Not necessarily straight,
but it should be a

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.030
line in this diagram.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.070
To have coexistence.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.330
So what this line is, then,
this line is the line of

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:37.230
points that tells me when I have
coexistence between the

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:41.350
gas phase and the
liquid phase.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.516
The coexistence line.

00:27:41.516 --> 00:27:44.960
This is the gas-liquids
coexistence

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.370
line for the mixture.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:55.440
It's not so different than this
coexistence line up here.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.250
So you can think of this as a
phase diagram, kind of like

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.810
you thought, you know this
as a phase diagram.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:05.360
It's got a coexistence line.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.400
And then if I'm above this
line, if I'm at a certain

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:13.810
pressure here, I'm at this
point here, this pressure

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:17.620
well, let's go to a
slightly higher

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.730
different pressure here.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.890
And this composition here.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.540
I'm not on the line.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.230
That means that I don't
have coexistence

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.380
between liquid and gas.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.260
I'm above the line.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:35.215
I'm at a pressure higher then
where I would get coexistence.

00:28:35.215 --> 00:28:38.060
The pressure is higher,
means I probably don't

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.170
have a gas any more.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.320
Probably means that the total
pressure pushing down on my

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.730
mixture is too high to have
a gas phase around.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:55.700
It means that the top part
here is a liquid phase.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.760
So I'm in the liquid phase if
I'm above this line and I have

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.590
a coexistence between the
gas and the liquid

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.310
if I'm on the line.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:13.210
Now, if I'm below this line
here, well, I get in trouble.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.740
I get in trouble because my
first instinct would be, well

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.120
this is just gas.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.400
I go from liquid, and then
I have coexistence.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.180
Then I go into the gas phase.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.090
But my x-axis here is
the composition

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.670
in the liquid phase.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.990
There's no liquid around.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:35.130
So I really can't say
anything here.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.300
This diagram is a little bit
meaningless down here.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.500
Because my x-axis is describing
a phase which

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.150
doesn't exist on the diagram.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.650
On this diagram, here.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.430
So when you see it, this diagram
here with Raoult's law

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.810
on it, you've got to remember
that the part that's really

00:29:54.810 --> 00:30:00.090
interesting is above the line
and at the line itself.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:14.100
So you could do an experiment,
then, on this line here.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:14.330
T fixed.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:20.170
This is the liquid phase.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.420
So suppose I start
with some high

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.620
pressure up here somewhere.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:29.220
At this point, let's call
this point one.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:36.680
We've got my container, my
piston here. p is equal to p1.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.676
Again, I put the point
in an awkward place.

00:30:38.676 --> 00:30:51.400
Let's put it right there.
p1, and composition xB.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.800
p1 and xB here.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:02.510
And I'm going to slowly
decrease the pressure.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.770
I start in this composition.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:05.720
The composition doesn't
change.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.070
I'm just decreasing
the pressure.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.450
Decrease the pressure, decrease
the pressure,

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.060
decrease the pressure.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:14.530
And at some point, I
get to that line.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:18.540
Get to that line, what happens
when I get to that line?

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.260
I start to see bubbles coming
out of the liquid.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.530
Vapor starts to form, because
it wants to be in the

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.330
coexistence line.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.490
So I get to that line.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:29.100
And I get a little bit
of bubbles forming.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.060
And a little bit of vapor.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.980
That's the liquid here.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.090
Little bit of gas.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:44.870
And that's why this line here
is called the bubble line.

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:48.250
So I've gone down, decreased
the pressure.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.740
So p has gone down now.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.600
Decreased the pressure.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:58.740
And if I keep on decreasing
pressure, well, I'm not going

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.450
to jump into this area
of the diagram.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.690
Because this area of the diagram
means there's no

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.410
liquid, it's a meaningless
area.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.416
If I keep decreasing the
pressure, I'm still going to

00:32:08.416 --> 00:32:09.190
be in coexistence.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.170
I'm just going to
make more gas.

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:13.170
More vapor.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.610
I'm going to transfer
more of the liquid

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.070
into the vapor phase.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:21.120
I'm going to ride
down that line.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.370
I'm going to ride
down the line.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:23.320
I'm decreasing the pressure.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.510
I'm not going to
skip into here.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:29.150
I'm going to ride down
the line here.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:33.690
We're going to keep decreasing
the pressure even more. p goes

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:34.060
down even more.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.820
Now, I make even more vapor.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:41.620
There's my piston right there.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.850
There's the gas phase.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.240
There's the liquid phase.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.400
Now I've transferred material
from the liquid

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.730
phase to the gas phase.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:55.810
But I also changed
the composition

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.500
of my liquid phase.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.420
And if I read my new
composition, this is what I

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.080
started out with. xB.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.990
My new composition in the liquid
phase is going to be,

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:15.220
let's call it xB prime.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.340
There's going to be more
solute in there.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:24.310
Or more B in there, than what
I started out with.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.800
Now which one was the
more volatile one?

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.950
A or B?

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.320
A was more volatile, right?

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:34.610
So as I decreased the pressure
and I started bubbling off the

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:38.410
material, which one's going to
bubble off preferentially?

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.910
A is going to.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:47.350
So it makes sense that I would
concentrate B in there.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:49.040
Decrease the pressure.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.820
Bubbles that are rich
in A come out.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.940
Both A and B come out.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.940
But more A comes out than B. And
what's left over is rich

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:01.080
and then more than the less
volatile material which is B.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:05.920
So we're beginning to see how
distillation comes about.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.730
This is the first step in it.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:18.220
In a distillation process.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.410
So let's make this a little
bit more complicated now.

00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:30.380
Any questions, first?

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.490
Alright, now, suppose
I wanted to know.

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:36.280
So I found out where the
composition in the liquid

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.080
phase is here.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.505
And I know that should tell
me immediately whether the

00:34:41.505 --> 00:34:43.970
composition in the gas
phase is here.

00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:47.860
So I have all, I have everything
I need to know to

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:52.030
calculate what the composition
in the gas phase is.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.220
So I have everything I need,
then, to calculate and draw a

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.510
diagram that looks
just like this.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:04.520
Except where my x-axis is the
y's instead of the x's.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.660
Going to make the same diagram,
except now I'm going

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.380
to use the gas phase as
my reference point.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:15.590
The composition in
the gas phase.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:22.190
So I need to get, so here I
got p as a function of xB.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:30.250
I want p, total pressure,
as a function of yB.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.240
So I can draw a diagram that
looks just like this except

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:41.310
now with the x-axis being the
gas phase composition.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.980
Let's turn the crank.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.880
What do I know?

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:55.400
I know Dalton's law. pA is
yA times total pressure.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.810
I'm trying mix up the partial
pressures and the total

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.950
pressure in all ways that
I know how to write it.

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.595
And then hope that something's
going to come out that's going

00:36:05.595 --> 00:36:06.540
to be helpful.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.700
So that's Dalton's law.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:17.960
I know Raoult's law. pA is
xA star times pA star.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:22.740
And that's Raoult.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.400
And I can write Raoult's
law in a different way.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:31.120
I can write as pB is equal to
xB pB star, that's just

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:41.310
Raoult's law for B. One
minus xA pB star.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:45.200
And I'm looking for this.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.340
I'm looking for the composition
in the gas phase.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.687
Or the total pressure as a
function of the composition in

00:36:50.687 --> 00:36:51.010
the gas phase.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.830
Let's start by finding the
composition in the gas phase

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.610
as a function of
the composition

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.450
in the liquid phase.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.990
And the total pressure.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:08.940
Rewrite yA is equal to
pA over P. Total

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.380
pressure is pA plus pB.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:16.320
Sum of the two partial
pressures. pA over pA plus pB.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.290
And I'm trying to get yA
in terms of the xA's.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.000
Or xB's, in terms
of composition

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.680
in the liquid phase.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.860
And I know how to relate
that to a constant.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.850
Which is the vapor pressure of
the pure material times the,

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.280
and the composition of the
liquid phase, Raoult's law.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:44.490
This is xA pA star divided by
xA pA star plus xB pB star.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.750
And I know that xB
is one minus xA.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:59.320
So this is xA pA star times pB
star plus pA star minus pB

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.900
star times xA.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:07.330
Where all I did was replace
xB with one minus xA.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.070
And rearrange my equation
on the bottom.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:15.310
So I've gotten the composition
in the gas phase in terms of

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.960
the composition in
the liquid phase.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.830
They're not independent.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.430
I knew they weren't
independent.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:24.220
And this just shows me
that math works.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:24.490
OK.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.500
So I've got that.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.620
And I can invert this to get the
composition in the liquid

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.080
phase in terms of the
composition in the gas phase.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:35.200
It's not so straightforward,
but you can get xA as a

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.720
function of yA, as well.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.300
You've got xA, if you reverse
this you get xA is

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.605
equal to yA pB star.

00:38:44.605 --> 00:38:54.420
It looks kind of the same. pB
star plus pA star plus pB star

00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:01.310
minus pA star times yA. xA
as a function of yA.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:05.880
Alright.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:11.690
So now you can actually put
everything together, starting

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.200
from Dalton's law.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.920
Because really what we want
is the total pressure as a

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.070
function of the composition
in the gas phase.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:20.500
So there's our total
pressure here.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.740
There's the composition
in the gas phase.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.520
There's pA.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.960
We've found composition in
the gas phase in terms of

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.930
composition in the
liquid phase.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:38.620
P is equal to yA over pA.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:45.050
Which is equal to yA
over xA pA star.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.030
So if we could get rid of
this here, in terms of

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:49.200
yA, we'd be all set.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.800
We'd get the total pressure as
a function of the composition

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.240
in the gas phase.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.860
And there's what we need.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.420
So we plug that in here.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:06.320
And now we have the total
pressure in terms of constants

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:12.310
like these pure vapor pressures
and the composition

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:18.380
of A in the gas phase.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.110
So let me find a way to
write that somewhere.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.870
Let me write it right here
in this little box here.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:29.150
Plug it in, you get something
that's not a straight line.

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.010
Unfortunately.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:37.330
Doesn't look like Raoult's law.
pA star pB star. pA star

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:48.790
plus pB star minus
pA star times yA.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:49.950
It's not a straight line.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:57.390
It's a more complicated
function.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:16.860
What does it look like?

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.430
Looks like this.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:23.050
I'm going to use the
same sort of plot.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.040
I going to plot the total
pressure on this axis here, on

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:25.920
the y axis.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.120
I'm going to keep the T fixed.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.210
Temperature is fixed.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.220
So I'm going to find the total
pressure as a function of the

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.270
composition in the gas phase.

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:42.870
I'm going to put yB here. yB
going from zero to one.

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:50.720
So it's kind of looking like
what I had before.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.990
Total pressure is going
to look the same.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.450
If you want to do it in terms of
B, you just have everywhere

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.240
you see B replace it with A.
And everywhere you see A

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:02.130
replace it with B. You just
need to change the two.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:06.730
You know that if yB is equal to
zero, that you have pure A.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:12.190
So you know that this is going
to be pA star here.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.630
You know if you have yB equals
to one in the gas phase, you

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:16.080
have pure B in the gas phase.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.320
You know that what you have is
the vapor pressure of the pure

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:26.540
B, in this case the pure
water. pB star, OK?

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:32.300
Where A is more volatile then B.
A would be the ethanol and

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.830
B would be the water.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:37.330
And it's not a straight line.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.414
If it were Raoult, he would
say just connect these two

00:42:39.414 --> 00:42:40.280
with a straight line.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.310
But it's not.

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:44.280
It's not, we just figured out
with an equation here.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:49.050
And it turns out to be a line
that looks like this.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:55.150
It's a curved line that
looks a bit like this.

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.020
OK, what does this line mean?

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:01.540
This line is also a
coexistence line.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:02.510
That's what we started
out with.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.410
We started out with Raoult.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:07.560
That was part of
our derivation.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:15.120
Raoult's law tells you the
composition at coexistence.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.260
Tells you the pressure of, the
total pressure, or partial

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.200
pressure at coexistence
and the composition.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.820
So this is a coexistence
line between the

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.390
liquid and the gas.

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:28.120
Coexistence between
liquid and gas.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.382
But now, it's not as a function
of the composition at

00:43:30.382 --> 00:43:30.990
the liquid phase.

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:34.500
It's a function of the
composition in the gas phase.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.460
Which was missing before.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:43.890
So now if I do my experiment,
and I'm, so

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:44.950
what does this mean?

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:48.540
So if I have a point, if I have
a pressure which is lower

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.110
than the line here, then
I have pure gas.

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:52.820
Pressure, low pressure,
I have pure gas.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.810
Don't have any liquids.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.950
And that's fine, because
I can, I know

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:57.600
what that point is.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.870
If I'm sitting below the
line here somewhere,

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:06.640
so I'm sitting here.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.630
Some composition in the gas
phase, a certain pressure.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.300
That's fine.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:15.280
It's a meaningful point.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.870
So my container here
has a piston on it.

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:26.120
And I'm starting out with
this pressure, p1 here.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.490
p1 pressing down.

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:30.240
And I got yB in this here.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.930
And I increase the pressure,
pressure goes up.

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:35.340
Composition doesn't change.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.250
I'm just increasing
the pressure.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:39.640
Increasing the pressure,
increasing the pressure.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.380
Now, at some point the pressure
becomes big enough

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.720
that I start to see
liquid forming.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:54.970
Little drops of liquid forming
in my container.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:58.255
So now I have little drops of
liquid that are forming in my

00:44:58.255 --> 00:45:01.750
container, that are going to
start to rain down and form a

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.290
little bit of liquid
pooling at the

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:05.640
bottom of the container.

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.420
And that's called
the dew line.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.860
The other one was called the
bubble line, this is called

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.520
the dew line.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.180
So when I reach the dew line,
I start forming liquid.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.210
And again, just like in the
previous case, if I keep

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.360
increasing the pressure, I don't
go into this area here.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.770
First of all, this area's
meaningless for

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:27.620
this diagram here.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:31.550
Because this area's
pure liquid.

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.070
But the x-axis here doesn't tell
me about the composition

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:34.530
of pure liquid.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:35.680
It's all yB.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.130
It's all about the composition
in the gas -- yes.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.130
PROFESSOR: Between the dew
line and the bubble line?

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.410
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:44.330
PROFESSOR: This never,
never world.

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:47.970
Where you're not allowed
to inhabit.

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:54.760
We're going to go into
that next time.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.920
On how to use those two
curves together.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.220
OK, but the same thing
happens here.

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.270
If I increase the pressure,
I'm going to ride the

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.680
coexistence line up.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:12.770
I ride it up, and keep
riding it up.

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.780
And I get liquid forming
in here.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.325
And I can find out the
composition in

00:46:16.325 --> 00:46:17.100
the gas phase now.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.490
The composition in the gas
phase, as I increase the

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:25.620
pressure, I get yB prime,
there's yB that I

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.920
started out with with.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:30.510
With yB prime is less than yB.

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:37.320
And remember, B was the less
volatile of the two.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:42.200
As I increase the pressure,
I am forming liquid.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.030
The composition in the
gas phase changes.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:50.750
You decrease the mole fraction
of the less volatile material

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:51.440
in the gas phase.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.300
The more volatile
A becomes more

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.010
prevalent in the gas phase.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:01.250
And what's coming down is
mostly, then, it's enriched in

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:07.190
B. You've done an enrichment of
the less volatile material

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:10.220
down in here.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:12.750
And now you can put the
two together, as the

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:19.420
question was asked.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.970
Now we can have, we mix
the two together.

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:27.610
We mix our Raoult diagram with
our dew line diagram.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.050
We mix the bubble line and
the dew line together.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:32.500
In one diagram, which
is going to be a

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:48.730
powerful diagram to use.

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.040
Total pressure.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.510
Temperature fixed.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:48:02.600
You've got two materials, pA
star is bigger than pB star.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:08.830
So I'm going to have pA star
here, pB star down here.

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:13.590
And if I choose, as my x-axis,
to have xB going from zero to

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:18.700
one, I can draw a coexistence
line on this axis.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:20.520
On this diagram.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.770
That's the coexistence
line in terms of xB.

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:29.910
And any point up here is
well-described by this xB

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.870
value, and the p value.

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:36.770
And as long as I have xB here,
I'm not allowed to touch the

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.600
bottom part of this diagram.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.220
But now if I add another x-axis,
I'm going to add yB.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.550
From zero to one.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.230
I draw a coexistence line
in terms of yB.

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:56.500
Like this.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.550
So this line is p
as a function of

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.850
yB coexistence line.

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:08.030
This line is total pressure
of function of xB.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:11.460
And as long as I'm on this line
or below this line, then

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:15.900
this axis makes sense.

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.320
That's how we build
this diagram here.

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.880
It's got a bubble line
on top, and the

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.520
dew line on the bottom.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:26.060
So I'm up here going down, I'm
going to hit the bubble line.

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.590
If I'm down here and go up
in pressure, I'm going

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:29.460
to hit the dew line.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.610
And next time -- well, next
time we have an exam.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:38.020
But on Friday, we'll figure out
how to use this diagram.
