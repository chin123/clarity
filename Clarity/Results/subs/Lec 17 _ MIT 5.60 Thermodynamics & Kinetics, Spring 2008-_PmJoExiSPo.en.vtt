00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.940
PROFESSOR: So today we're going
to do an example of

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:34.780
using some of the equilibrium
concepts that we've learned to

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.370
drug design.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.890
And it's going to be an example
that's out in the

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.410
literature.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.210
And potentially a very big
deal if you can do

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.220
drug design this way.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.920
And it's an example of how,
remember how I told you that

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.680
if you have the Gibbs free
energy, you have everything

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.730
and how clueless I was as a
graduate student, and when I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.130
look back I think how silly it
was for me not to realize how

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.050
important it was.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.750
Well, this is an example where
people calculate delta G's or

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.720
Gibbs free energy changes for
binding of proteins to

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.450
receptors on cells,
or ligands.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.830
And from that, design drugs that
work much better than the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.610
real thing.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.330
And it's all about calculating
delta G. We're going to see

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.580
how that is, and how that comes
in with equilibrium.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.070
So the paper that this
is based on was

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.230
published in 2002.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.240
And since then there have
been larger-scale

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.600
trials, animal trials.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.010
And I believe there have been
human trials of this concept,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.420
of this drug that they
have designed.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.540
You've got the reference
in the notes.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.580
And we're going to have to do
a little bit of review of

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.730
biology first, to figure
out what's going on.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:08.340
And this particular process,
this particular drug, is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.650
called the, I have
it right here,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.920
granulocyte stimulating factor.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.880
Where was it in here?

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:32.040
To give you the right
name for it.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.680
There it is.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.300
It's a protein drug
called GCSF.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.270
Granulocyte Colony Stimulating
Factor.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.280
And it's there's wild
tie for natural

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.940
version of this protein.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.520
That is generated by
normal tissue.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.230
And this protein goes to the
blood, to the bone marrow.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.320
And it binds the receptors on
cells that are in the blood

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.800
and the bone marrow, and
stimulates the growth of white

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.650
blood cells, and stem cells, and
also acts to tell the bone

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.630
marrow to pump out these stem
cells into the blood.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.260
And the problem is that if you
have a chemotherapy patient,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.210
their bone marrow cells are
largely destroyed through the

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.370
chemotherapy.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.800
And so they have a problem
with the white blood cell

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.060
counts, and with stem cell
counts and all that stuff.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.630
So one of the ways that you
can try to reverse this

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.460
problem is by stimulating,
artificially stimulating the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.610
growth or the proliferation of
these white blood cells.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.030
And one of the ways you could
do that is by giving the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.180
patient a lot of this protein,
granulocyte colony stimulating

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.760
factor, to stimulate the output
of white blood cells

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.850
from the bone marrow.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.490
Whatever is left of
the bone marrow.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.790
To rebuild it up.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.760
And so that's done with wild
type, with protein.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.230
You can make the wild
type protein.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.750
But if you had something that
was basically the same thing

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.080
but somehow mutated, where you
made a few changes to the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.780
amino acid sequence, so that it
worked a little bit better,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.750
then you might have a lot of
people, a lot of patients.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.490
And that's what the basis
of this paper is, that's

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.970
referenced here.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.050
Is how to go about mutating this
protein here to make it a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.700
drug that would be
more effective

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.640
then the natural protein.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.020
So that you can give
it to patients.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.160
So now let me go back and tell
you a little bit about this

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.270
equilibrium that we're
talking about.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.790
So we've been talking
about equilibria of

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.670
molecules coming together.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.820
And then creating
new molecules,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.480
products and reactants.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.790
Well, when you're talking about
ligands and receptors on

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.883
cells, the same sort
of ideas come in.

00:05:12.883 --> 00:05:14.720
The same equilibrium
concepts come in.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:23.550
So if you have a cell membrane,
the cell membrane

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.820
could have a receptor in it.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.760
Which is a protein that extends
through the membrane

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.270
that's got some sort of
pocket outside here.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.710
The membrane keeps on going.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.820
And you've got the blood on the
outside here, or some of

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.430
the tissue of the cells,
and you've got the

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.270
inside of the cell here.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.910
And this receptor is waiting
for some ligand.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.290
A ligand being another protein
that's floating around.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.430
That's specific for binding
to this receptor here.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.800
And there's the ligand here.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.310
There's the receptor here.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.770
And every now and then one of
these ligands will find a

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.130
receptor and bind to it.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.250
So we write, then, in
equilibrium, ligand plus

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.330
receptor goes to complex.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.030
This is happening all
the time on cells.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.310
There are millions of different
kinds of receptors,

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.170
millions, billions of
kinds of ligands.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.710
Wild types, fake ones,
et cetera et cetera.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.370
When you've got a binding event,
the cell knows that's

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.400
something has bound, usually.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.410
And that usually triggers a
cascade of other things.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.030
It signals a cell to
do a lot of things.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:47.220
So, for instance, in the case
of the GCSF, you've got the

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.430
receptor on the cell.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.630
And you've got this granulocyte
colony signaling

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.010
factor, that would be
the ligand here.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.950
It binds to the receptor
on the cell.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.440
That triggers the bone marrow
cells to produce more

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.780
proteins, which signals more
things to happen, and

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.280
eventually down the way, after
a bunch of signaling

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.440
processes, out come a
burst of stem cells

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.070
or white blood cells.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.040
It's a complicated process,
and every step of the way

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.590
needs to be done correctly.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.860
And for this process at least,
this protein here, this ligand

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.170
protein, triggers the cascade.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.720
And so this binding and
unbinding of this protein then

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.660
triggers the whole sequence
of reactions.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:33.230
So this equilibrium becomes
super-important then.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.810
OK.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.480
What else should we review
about, I should have used a

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.420
different board than
this, but.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.220
This is going to
get covered up.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.230
What else can we review about
biology that would be

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.630
interesting?

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:50.800
So, other things that we will
need to remember, need to

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.220
know, is that these receptors
on the surface of the cells

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.970
aren't static.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.610
The cells recycle
their receptors.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.300
Things can happen.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.480
Things get degraded.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.870
And so the cell is constantly
taking these receptors,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.800
bringing them back inside the
cell, merging them with

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.180
lysosomes, where the pH is five,
or 5.5 compared to the

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.190
outside of the blood,
which is 7.4.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.020
It breaks down the proteins into
their amino acids, the

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.980
cell can use the amino acids
again to make more proteins.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.560
Make better, make
new receptors.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.000
And that's how the cell recycles
the receptors.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.690
So basically, you end up with
the cell taking the receptor.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:40.550
Making a small sort of cavity
around the receptor.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.940
So there's the cell
sitting here.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.910
There's the inside
of the cell.

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.670
There's the receptor being
engulfed by the cell, now.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.420
And it could have the ligand
in on it, also.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.850
There's the ligand sitting
right here.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.330
It's called an endocytotic
event, or it's endocytosis of

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.140
the receptor.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.670
Into the cell.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.300
And then once you're inside
the cell, let's put the

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.570
nucleus in the middle here,
you've got things called

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.210
lysosomes that are
sitting nearby.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.730
There's a lysosome here.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.460
Lysosome.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.700
And there's your little
vesicle that

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.790
contains your receptor.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:30.900
Merges towards the lysosome,
these two get together.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:44.140
Then you have your ligand, I'm
running out of colors here.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.350
So there's the receptor and the
ligand together in here.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.770
And then the pH here becomes
5.5, things break apart.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.970
And you've got to find another
receptor, another ligand, to

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.610
continue the process.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.180
Everybody knows this biology,
or you know it well enough.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.520
OK, good.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:14.430
So let's go do this example.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.130
So this is the process
of binding.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.940
We can have a delta G associated
with this, delta G

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:26.830
a, delta G0 is minus
RT log K sub a.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.430
This is the association
equilibrium.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.030
And you can have the reverse
process, where the complex

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.890
gets broken up into receptor
plus a ligand.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.680
And then you have a delta
G for this process here.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.800
So this is delta Ga,
let's call it.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:55.590
This would be delta GD, which is
the negative minus RT log K

00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:00.240
sub D. This is the dissociation
process.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.240
And the dissociation process,
K sub D, is equal to R, the

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.100
concentration of the receptors
times the concentration of the

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.320
ligand, divided by the
concentration of the complex.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.140
And the lower K sub D is, the
smaller this number is, small

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.150
means that you're mostly on this
side here, mostly in the

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.250
complex, the tighter
the binding.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:41.350
So small KD means
tight binding.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.150
So if I want, in principle,
then, if I want to design a

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:51.360
drug that's going to signal this
event here, I want K sub

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.510
D for this ligand that
I'm going to

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.960
design to be very small.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.160
To be small.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.840
Small enough so that it binds
strongly and does its job, so

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.130
I don't need too much of it.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.450
Now, you need to do experiments
to figure out

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.540
what's going on.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.890
So how do you do these
experiments?

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.900
You need to be able to measure,
then these K sub D's,

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.630
experimentally, to see whether
or not what you've designed on

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.960
the computer, when you calculate
delta G's on the

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.260
computer you've got to know
whether or not it's working.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.750
And this is still an
experimental science.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.860
How does it work?

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.020
So, usually you do the
experiment with the ligand

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:43.520
concentration very high.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.630
Very large.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.150
So that the concentration of
the ligand at any time is

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.320
basically the same thing as
the concentration of the

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.440
ligand you put in.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.470
So you overwhelm the system
with ligands.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.450
So that L is much bigger than
C or R, and so it doesn't

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.090
matter which way the
equilibrium is.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.370
L stays roughly the same.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.800
So you know, throughout
the experiment, what

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.400
concentration is.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:16.740
Then you get a bunch of cells.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.450
In a well or something, or a 96
well plate with a bunch of

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.030
different kinds of ligands.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:26.820
And you can take your ligand,
you can label it

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.200
radioactively.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.380
So you can take your ligand
as some long protein.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:39.100
And you can take an iodine 125,
let's say, radioactive

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.480
label on your ligand,
on your protein.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.360
So you can keep track of it.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.460
The nice thing about radioactive
labels, and which

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.560
is why people use them in
biology or bio-medicine.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.620
We use them to look at, for
instance, bio-distribution of

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.200
things in animals.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.800
We want to know where things
are, and whether they all left

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.190
the animal, or.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.950
Because you can use a Geiger
counter and you

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.440
can count the events.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.810
The radioactive events.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:13.620
And that gives you extremely
quantitative analysis of where

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.690
things are.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:18.510
So you take those radioactive
ligand.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.940
And, L0, very large
concentration.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.850
You expose this concentration
to the cells.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.220
The cells have some receptors
on the surface.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.940
There's a bunch of receptors
on the surface of the cell.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.020
And some fraction of the
receptors will have the ligand

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.980
bound to them.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:37.840
So you incubate.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.930
You let it wait a while.

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:45.180
Then you wash.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.600
So you get rid of all
the excess ligand

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.200
that's on top there.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:55.860
And then you take your petri
dish, or your 96 well plate.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.610
And you read the radioactivity
that's coming from the cells.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.930
And that signal, that
radioactive signals, tells you

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:06.910
exactly how many ligand you
have on these cells.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.930
You knew what the cell
concentration was initially.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.090
So that tells you what the
concentration of ligands, of

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.200
complexes, was.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:22.760
So this experiment then gets
you, experimentally, gets you

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.470
the concentration of
C, the complex.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.530
So now this is something
you know.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.610
You also know what L0
was, because that's

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.410
what you put in.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.930
And that's enough for you
to find out what KD is.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.430
And if you know what KD
is, then you know

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:42.080
what delta G0 is.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:49.880
And so generally, then, let's
go ahead and do that.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.810
So we know what L is.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:16:01.750
We know what L0, C is, let me
just do it on this board here.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:07.530
So we start with rewriting KD as
equal to R times L divided

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.160
by the complex concentration.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:15.680
And now L is basically L0, so we
can use that approximation.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.100
So we have L0 sitting here.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.900
We still have the complex on
the bottom, and that's

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.960
something that we've
experimentally discovered.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.860
And the concentration of
receptors, this is the

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.550
concentration of receptors
that don't have

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.480
anything bound to them.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.030
So it's these guys right here.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.620
That's equal to the
concentration of receptors,

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.360
the total number of receptors,
minus those receptors that

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.870
have a ligand bound to them.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.720
Complexes.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.570
Something we can

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.110
experimentally define, or discover.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:57.190
So we replace this R here with
RT minus C. And then we're all

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:57.920
at equilibrium.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.990
So we're going to put a little
equilibrium sign under these

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.060
C's here. equilibrium.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.390
And then we can rearrange this
equation so that, people like

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.100
to have plots that are linear,
in a way that is a linear

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:18.980
plot, where the slope of the
plot is the inverse of the

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.320
equilibrium constant.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.480
So you do some massaging
of this equation here.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.430
And you rewrite it in
terms of C over L0.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:37.600
There's the equilibrium
concentration of the complex.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:43.250
This is the total receptor
concentration divided by the

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.160
equilibrium constant.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:50.350
And then you have the
equilibrium concentration of

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:57.910
the complex divided by KD.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.920
And so you plot, then,
this ratio.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.420
Which is an experimental
ratio.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.920
You've just measured this
concentration of complexes

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.670
using this radioactivity,
radioactive labeling

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.210
experiment.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.450
You know what this is, because
that's what you've put in.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.230
This is your x-axis
on your plot.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.680
This is what you've measured.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.020
And this is going
to be the slope.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:31.000
It's called a Scatchard plot.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.890
After Mr. Scatchard

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.630
So you get a straight line.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.560
So we're plotting here
the equilibrium

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.410
constant of the complex.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.320
And on this here we're plotting
the ratio of the

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.200
complex divided by L0.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:57.220
And we get this straight line
like this, where the slope is

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.590
one over KD.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:07.290
Minus one over KD.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:11.820
OK, now there's a couple of
things that you can look at

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.350
that are sometimes useful.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:20.090
In this analysis here.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:24.710
You can also rewrite this
equation up here in terms of

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:29.950
the ratio of C equilibrium
divided by RT.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:34.630
So that's basically the ratio
of receptors that have a

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.870
ligand attached to them,
divided by the total

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.220
concentration of receptors.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:45.600
So if most of the receptors
are empty, then this is a

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.690
small number.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.860
Then most of the receptors are
taken up, this is a number

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.760
close to one.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.140
It can't be anywhere, it can't
be ever bigger than one,

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.320
because the biggest number of
complexes you can get is the

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.990
total number of receptors.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.410
So if you take this equation
here and you massage it a

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:10.630
little bit, one over one plus KD
over L0, and that, you can

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.410
also plot that.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:19.400
As a function of L0.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.390
How much ligands you put in.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.370
And you find this is something
that saturates at one.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.390
So this ratio here is going
to saturate at one.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:34.670
This is C equilibrium divided by
total number of receptors.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:42.200
And so if L0 is small enough, if
L0 is small enough, meaning

00:20:42.200 --> 00:21:05.690
that it's smaller than KD, so if
L0 is much smaller then KD,

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:14.390
then you can rearrange this
ratio here so that C

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:24.980
equilibrium divided by RT
is roughly L0 over KD.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.180
So that's linear, with a
slope of one over KD.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:33.670
So this slope here is one
over KD is the slope.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:39.280
And as you get L0 to be quite
large, bigger than KD, then

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.330
this saturate to one.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.780
And this one over something very
large become zero, and

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.510
basically you end up with
something close to one.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.030
So you saturate at one.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.240
So that's another way
of doing this.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.020
But this is really what we
want to concentrate here.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.400
The fact that you can get KD
out of experimentally.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.970
If you have KD, you
have delta G.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:05.330
So now let's go back and think
about this whole process here.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:09.750
If we're going to design this
drug here, this protein,

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.440
artificially.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.450
So what you want, then, is you
want something that's going to

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:18.170
bind strongly enough to
receptor, to stimulate the

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:24.480
growth of granulocytes, or the
colony of granulocytes.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.770
But when the cell decides to
recycle the receptor, and

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.840
destroy it, chew it apart in
the lysosome here, you want

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.220
this drug not to be degraded.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.280
Because you have to keep
injecting in the patient.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.210
So you want this drug to release
from the receptor,

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.830
before the lysosome has a
chance to chew it up.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.470
So that means that you want the
equilibrium constant at pH

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:58.120
5.5, you want that KD, to be
much larger at 5.5 than you

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.060
want it at 7.4.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.790
You want strong binding at
pH 7.4, and you want weak

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.020
binding at pH 5.5.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.980
That way the drug
gets recycled.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.290
Can find, go back
to the blood.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.760
Bind to a receptor again,
generate the signaling events,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.310
gets engulfed by the cell.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.220
Releases before it has
a chance to be

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.300
chewed up, et cetera.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.990
The wild type will
get chewed up.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.020
The regular kind will get chewed
up, and so that's why

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.400
you have to, with the patients
you have to keep giving them

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.750
this drug over and over again.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:34.620
Because it gets chewed
up by the cells.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.530
So that's the design principle
that these authors had in mind

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.950
when they started their study.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.840
And so they knew what the
sequence, what the amino acid

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.470
sequence was, for this wild type
drug, and they started

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.720
doing point mutations.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.870
Changing one amino acid
here and there.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.990
And cranking out the calculation
to calculate delta

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:59.740
G for binding of this protein
to this receptor.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.990
At pH 7.4 and at pH
5.5, and getting

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.120
differences of delta G's.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:11.770
So let me then review again.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:19.390
What is the motivation here.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:27.260
The motivation is to try to
get the ratio, KD, at 5.5

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:33.040
divided by KD at 7.4, pH 7.4.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.750
And you want this to
be bigger than one.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.720
And really as large
as possible.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.660
As possible, of course
within limits.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:47.150
So we want this to
bind at pH 7.4.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:57.940
And the point of comparison
is the wild types.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:07.770
Which at 7.4 has a KD
of 270, roughly.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:18.690
And at the ratio of pH
5.5 to 7.4 is 1.7.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:23.150
So it's a little bit weaker
binding at 5.5.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.570
Remember, large KD means
weak binding.

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.890
Small KD means tight binding.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:34.820
So the fact that KD at 5.5 is
bigger than KD at 7.5 means

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.540
that it's slightly weaker
binding at 5.5 than 7.4.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:43.570
So this is sort of the baseline
that the protein

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.120
designers had to deal with.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:53.800
So everything gets compared
to this guy here.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.480
So they don't actually, in
a calculation they don't

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.990
actually measure this.

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.920
What they do is, they
look at delta G's.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:09.630
And so they look at differences
of delta G's.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:16.750
They look at delta G0 for
the binding of the

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.590
ligand to the receptor.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:28.650
At 7.4 minus the delta G0 at
pH 5.5, let's call this the

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:38.070
delta delta G. Since you know
delta G is minus RT log K,

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:45.990
this is equal to minus the delta
of log KD, which is log

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:54.310
KD at 5.5 divided
by KD at 7.4.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.460
So then they calculate delta
delta G0, and it's completely

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:04.060
related to this ratio that you
measured in the experiment.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:12.570
And so for the wild type, this
delta delta G is just

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.620
basically the log of
this number here.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:23.060
Is 0.53.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.540
So now they go ahead and
do their calculation.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.640
And they find a couple
of mutants.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.620
Where, and they focus
on delta delta G0.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.980
They want something that's
bigger than this.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.950
And then they'll worry about
whether there are more

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.540
problems associated with it.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:47.260
So they found two mutants,
let's call

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:58.660
them D110H and D113H.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.580
I think it's a histidine
mutation, point mutation at

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:10.835
110 and 113, where this ratio
here was 8.3 and 17.

00:28:10.835 --> 00:28:14.260
So, huge differences here.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:19.220
More than a factor of 20, or
factor of 30 difference in the

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.280
change in the binding
efficiency, at least according

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.540
to these delta delta G, between
pH 5.5 and pH 7.4.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.610
That means that this protein
here with the point mutation,

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.940
with this one point mutation, if
it binds as strongly to the

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:40.100
receptor on the surface, as soon
as the lysosome comes in

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:46.430
and begins to decrease pH inside
the cell, this ligand

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.300
is going to come off.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.930
And it's going to be
able to float away.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.550
Hopefully, before it
gets recycled.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.750
Before it gets chewed up.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.320
So they can be used again.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:03.600
So that's good.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.950
Alright, so experiments
were done.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:17.520
And on the D110H
and the D113H.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.935
And KD was measured in
the experiments.

00:29:19.935 --> 00:29:22.140
And remember, the wild
type is 270.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.750
The KD's were at 370.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.620
And 320, with some error bar.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.590
And the different, the ratios
of KD's were measured.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:37.160
There were 4.4 and 6.8.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.930
With some error bars.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.880
And they turned out to match
reasonably well, at least as

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.030
far as comparison between
experiment and theory.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.020
Still not great for these sorts
of calculations, because

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.490
pretty involved.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.150
A lot of approximations
go on in there.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:56.360
And it gives you
a rough guide.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.160
So this 17 here is probably not
quite right, because it

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.300
doesn't quite translate
to 6.8 here.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.040
This difference between 4.4 and
6.8 doesn't quite match

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.270
the difference that they saw
here in the calculation.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.940
But it's the right
direction, right?

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.090
And that's why you still
need to do experiments.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.170
This number here is a
little bit bigger

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:13.990
than this number here.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:19.370
Which means that these don't
bind quite as strongly.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.910
Because KD small means
strong binding.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.380
That means the initial binding
of the ligand to the receptor

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:28.340
is not quite as good
as the wild type.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.210
That's often the case.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.340
It's often not so easy to find
something that binds as

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.000
strongly as the wild version.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.360
But, it's good enough.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.540
And this ratio is really
what clamps the deal

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.550
in this case here.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:59.080
And so, these mutants, in fact
these two mutants are the ones

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.060
that have undergone
the animal trials.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.770
That are in the pipeline.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:07.880
This is a big deal.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.400
This is a big deal because this
is a huge, huge market.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.720
There's a very large number of
people that are affected with

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.480
chemotherapy.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.720
And this is basic thermodynamics
here.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.990
It's basic thermodynamic
calculation of a complicated

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:32.980
molecule with some fairly simple
equilibrium concepts.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:47.460
OK, any questions on this?

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:53.180
OK, well, we're ended
really early today.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.120
I don't have the phase
transition ready, but Keith

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.980
Nelson is going to start a phase
transition next time.
