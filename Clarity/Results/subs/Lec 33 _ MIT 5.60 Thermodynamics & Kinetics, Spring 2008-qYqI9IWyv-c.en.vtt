00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.480
PROFESSOR: So last time we were
starting more complicated

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:37.760
mechanisms and we looked
at series reactions.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.220
A goes B, which is
an intermediate.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.830
Goes to C with rates
k1 and k2.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.380
And we solved the
problem exactly.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.470
Which turned out to be a
little bit complicated.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.030
And then we were looking
at special cases.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.350
And I left the special case
of k1 equals k2 to do as a

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.510
homework problem.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.390
And then on the board we did
k1 much greater than k2.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.680
Which looks like, if k1 is much
greater than k2, the rate

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.660
into k1 is much greater than
k2, so using the analogy of

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:35.860
buckets and pipes, it's a big
pipe between k1 and between A

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.090
and B. And a little pipe
between B and C and you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.250
started with a bunch
of liquid on top.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.270
And you basically dump
it into here.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
And then you slowly
drip into C here.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.160
So the first thing that happens
is that A gets dumped,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.840
it becomes B very quickly.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.840
With a rate constant k1.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.260
In a first order fashion.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.460
So A is A0 e to the minus
k1 times time.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.710
Then B comes up sharply.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.610
And then drops down with rate
constant k2 slowly.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.750
So B is approximately A0 e to
the minus k2 times time.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.240
And then C has a very small
quadratic rise, followed by

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.790
the exponential rise to
saturation that you'd expect.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.300
So C is approximately a0 times
one minus e to the minus k2

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.080
times time.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.300
The rate constant k2 dominates
the long times.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.890
And everything it's looking like
it's pseudo first order

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.310
at long times.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.680
So you can do this either by
thinking about it, solve the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.650
problem by thinking about it,
which is perfectly fine.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.250
Or you can do it by solving
it exactly, as we

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.060
have done last time.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.500
And then putting in the
right approximations.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.320
Which in this case was Taylor's
approximation, if I

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.900
remember right.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.110
And know just by looking at the
equation and putting the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.100
right approximation,
you get it out.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:22.030
And a third approximation, which
is the opposite one, k2

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.260
much less than k1, so k1 much
less than k2, the way that

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:39.720
that's going to look, we can
do it by inspection.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.970
So basically if we think of
buckets and pipes, that's a

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.440
very thin pipe connecting the
bucket for A and B, so we drip

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.560
from A to B, then we have this
very fat pipe connecting B and

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.710
C. So as soon as a little B gets
in there, it immediately

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.740
becomes C. So, the rate
determining step is the first

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.620
one, A goes to B. And so k1, we
expect that to be the rate

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.770
that dominates the long time.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:17.230
And we never expect to get any
significant amount of B to

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.620
pile up in the middle bucket,
because this pipe is much

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.180
bigger than that one here.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.860
Therefore, what we expect to see
is a slow decay in A, with

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.730
rate constant k1 dominating
the long times, A is

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:40.070
approximately A0 e to the
minus k1 times the time.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.910
We don't expect B to amount
to very much at all.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.220
It'll rise up a little bit at
the very early times, and

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.210
it'll pretty much stay
very, very small.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.700
Not quite constant.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:01.450
And in fact if you look at the
full result, and you put in

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.680
your approximations, and I'll
let you do that, you would

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.675
find that B is essentially
related to A through a

00:05:10.675 --> 00:05:15.500
constant term where k1 is very
small compared to k2.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.530
So this is a very small
number here.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.120
B is equal to a very small
number times A. So it

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.670
basically follows A, but at
a very very, low level.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:33.850
And then you would find that C
rises up in approximately e to

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.990
the minus k1 times t, so
with rate constant k1.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:45.700
One minus e to the minus
k1 times the time.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.370
So the dominant rate is k1, and
in this case here this is

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.250
an approximation that we're
going to see again.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.120
We're going to revisit this
approximation here when we get

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.870
to more complicated mechanisms,
it's going to

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.340
become this steady state
approximation.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.710
Where the amount of the
intermediate, or the

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.250
concentration of intermediate,
is low at all times.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.150
And doesn't change very fast.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.220
The slope here is very slow.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.980
Because k1 is so slow coming
down, and B is related to A,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.850
which means it's related to this
slow decrease in A, the

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.350
amount of B is small and the
rate of change in B is also

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.070
very small.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.610
And hopefully we'll
get to that very

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.530
soon in this lecture.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.900
OK, so that's a summary of
what we did last time.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.540
Any questions?

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:50.050
So the next thing now is to
go to the next mechanism.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.960
Which is, so far we've looked
at reactions that

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.910
proceed all the way.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.200
We haven't looked at
equilibrium yet.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.120
But we know thermodynamics
is all about equilibrium.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.970
So now we're going to connect
kinetics and thermodynamics.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.620
We're going to look at a
mechanism which is an

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.400
equilibrium mechanism.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:16.920
Equilibrium or reversible
reactions.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.380
Where you have A goes to B, with
summary constant k1, but

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.600
you can have the reverse process
B goes back to A with

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.870
the rate constant k minus one.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:35.240
Or you can write is as A k1, k
minus one to B, where k1 could

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.600
be k forward and k minus one
could be k backwards.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.330
Also written as k sub
f, and this is also

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.110
written as k sub b.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.290
So now we have more

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.360
information than we had before.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.930
Because now we know this is
an equilibrium problem.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.830
And we already know about
equilibrium from

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.020
thermodynamics.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.840
And we know that at equilibrium,
in addition to

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.580
all the rate laws that we're
going to write down to solve

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.940
the problem, we also know
that at equilibrium, the

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.900
equilibrium constant is related
to the equilibrium

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.980
concentrations.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.130
To the ratio of the equilibrium
concentrations.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:19.040
This is something additional
that we have.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.900
So let's write down everything
we know.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.290
And our goal is to find
out the time, the

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.420
dynamics of this problem.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.400
Suppose you start at some time
t equals zero, at a certain

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.030
amount of A0 in your pot, a
certain amount of B0, how do

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.270
you get to equilibrium.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.240
What's the rate, what
does it look like?

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.790
So the first thing is to
write down the rates.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:47.300
So the forward rate minus dA/dt,
which is the forward

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:53.000
rate, R sub forward is equal
to k1 times A. And the

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.200
backwards rate, minus dB/dt,
which we can write as R sub

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:15.750
backwards, that's k minus one
times B. At equilibrium, we

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.790
have no dynamics.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.450
Or no ensemble dynamics.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.610
The pot looks constant.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.330
It doesn't look like anything's
going on in there.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.300
The concentration of
A doesn't change.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.930
The concentration of
B doesn't change.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.510
They're constant at the
equilibrium concentration.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.600
So that implies that the rate
of formation of B must be

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.620
equal to the rate of destruction
of B. Or, in other

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.890
words, that the rate forward at
equilibrium has to be equal

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.280
the rate backwards.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.020
Otherwise, there'd be changes
in concentrations.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.930
So if that's true, then that
means that at equilibrium, k1

00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:02.050
A equilibrium has to be equal to
k minus one B equilibrium.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:10.990
Which means that we can get this
ratio of B to A. And see

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:16.830
that this is equal to
k1 over k minus one.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.970
So we've just, this is
pretty major here.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.170
Looks pretty simple,
but we've taken an

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.350
equilibrium property here.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.900
And related to kinetics.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:34.440
To a rate property.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.070
So here we have kinetics.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:46.440
Here we have thermo.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.960
And this is going to turn out
to be, this kind of ratio

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.530
between forward rates and
backwards rates, related to

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.180
equilibrium constants is going
to be valid, not just for this

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.730
very simple mechanism we have
here with just two species.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.270
But it's going to be valid
for more complicated.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.510
And we have two species reacting
to form another

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:09.050
species, or bimolecular
stuff, et cetera.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.460
OK, so now we've laid
the groundwork,

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.990
let's look at the dynamics.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.820
Let's look at the
time evolution.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.210
So that means that we need
to take, well this

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:19.980
is not quite right.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.230
I shouldn't write minus dA/dt.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:32.380
This is minus dA/dt rate forward
in the absence of

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:38.290
reverse process.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.550
It says just the destruction of
A and not the creation of

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:48.550
A. So if you look at the full
kinetics, the full mechanism,

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.560
this also, the rate backwards is
minus dB/dt, in the absence

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.360
of forming B back through
the reverse process.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.590
So both of these are
in the absence of

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.700
their reverse process.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:07.150
The full kinetics, for the
destruction of A. A is the

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.470
rate backwards, or the rate
forwards, which is k1 times A,

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.030
and then the rate backwards,
which is the creation of A.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.840
That's the two rates together.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.860
Minus k minus one times B.
There's the formation of A

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.050
here, this is the destruction
of A. This is the full

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.960
differential equation for
the full mechanism.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.760
Not just one part of it.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.990
This one here is just for the
first step, and that one here

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.090
is for the second step.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.920
This is what we need to solve.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:40.690
But now we have a lot of help
by what we've already done.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.320
So, what we can do is well, the
problem here is that's it

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.080
looks hard because there's
B included in here.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.970
This is not just A,
there's B in here.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.380
But there's only two species.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.580
And stoichiometry is going
to help us out.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.500
Remember last time, or a few
times ago, we said the last

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.990
species is the easy one.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.340
Because it's always related to
the concentration of all the

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.790
other species by
stoichiometry.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.400
And the last one here is B. So
we know that B is related to

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.130
A. B is whatever you
started out with.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.450
Plus whatever you used
up for A. That's one

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.040
way of writing it.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.310
So you start with this amount,
and you create this amount.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:24.950
By having A react.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.480
This is what you started with,
A, and this is what's left.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.560
The difference has to go into
B. So stroke stoichiometry

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:38.480
give you a relationship, which
you can use to plug into your

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.230
differential equation here.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.740
And now, after rearranging your
differential equation,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:49.150
putting B in there, you can
rewrite this as k1 plus k

00:13:49.150 --> 00:14:01.310
minus one times A minus k minus
one times B0 plus A0.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.380
Something which depends
on A, something

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.900
which is constant here.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.770
OK, and what else do we know?

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.180
We know something about
equilibrium.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.000
We know something about when
we reach a state where the

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.830
rate forward is equal to
the rate backward.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.510
When the rate forward is equal
to the rate backwards, the

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.760
rate of change of A is zero.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.590
A is not changing.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.070
The concentration of
A is not changing.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:38.170
So at equilibrium, dA/dt
is equal to zero.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.850
And just like in this example
here, this is going to turn

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.980
out to be related to an
approximation called the

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.170
steady state approximation,
which we're going to see later

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.560
this morning.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.070
Writing at equilibrium that
the change in the

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.770
concentration of one of the
species is equal to zero,

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.320
we're going to use that as an
approximation also later, when

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.570
we get to more complicated
mechanisms.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.830
This is going to be the
equilibrium approximation.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.740
And this is going to be the
steady state approximation.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.500
Let's keep going with our, we're
solving this guy here.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.660
So at equilibrium, dA/dt
is equal to zero.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:27.280
And then we can replace our
concentrations here with, and

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.890
so if you write equal to zero
here, then we can write it as

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.040
equilibrium right here.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.250
And we'll be able to solve for
A equilibrium in terms of k1,

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:40.580
k minus one, B0, and A0.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.250
And then if you do that, you get
A equilibrium is equal to

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:53.000
k minus one over k1 plus k minus
one times B0 plus A0.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.870
And we're going to need that.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:05.700
Because now we're going to be
able to plug this, so there's

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.540
A0 plus B0 sitting here.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.880
And we're going to replace
A0 plus B0 in terms of A

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.030
equilibrium.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.320
There's a minus sign here.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:21.730
And between this A and this
A equilibrium here, so by

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:27.060
rewriting, by plugging in A B0
A equilibrium instead of B0

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:36.830
plus A0, we can rewrite that
equation as dA/dt is equal to

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:45.310
k1 plus k minus one times
A minus A equilibrium.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.020
This is nice because, this
quantity, A minus A

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.890
equilibrium, describes the
difference between where are

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.070
you are and where
you want to be.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.820
It's a nice variable to have.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.960
It's going to change in time and
at infinite time, this is

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.560
going to go to zero.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.510
A is going to go
to equilibrium.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.500
A equilibrium is a constant.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.110
Now we have a differential
equation that relates A to

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.440
this difference.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.500
But A equilibrium
is a constant.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.960
So there's nothing that forbids
us from just writing

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:20.210
minus A equilibrium here. d
of a constant dt is zero.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:24.300
So I'm just basically
subtracting zero here.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.590
So and I have something of the
form dx/dt is equal to

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:28.370
constant times x.

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.430
And I know how to write that.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.790
That looks just like a
first order process.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:39.630
I know the solution is A minus
A equilibrium is equal to my

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.540
initial A, my initial state.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:52.510
A0 times e to the minus k1 plus
k minus one times time.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.270
And I've solved the problem.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:18:00.990
I've described how, as a
function of time, how A, the

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.100
concentration of A,
gets equilibrium.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.680
And if you want to know B,
it's just the same thing.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.360
You replace B here
and B0 here.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.940
You put k minus one here, k1
here, but it's the same thing.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:32.560
So if you were to sketch it
out as a function of time,

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.500
there's, eventually you'll get
to the concentration A

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.120
equilibrium.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.120
If you're above it, you're
going to decay in a first

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.840
order fashion, with a
rate constant k1.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:51.810
A minus A equilibrium is A0
minus A equilibrium e to the

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:58.220
minus k prime times t, where k
prime is k1 plus k minus one.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.340
And this is when A is greater
than A0, A equilibrium.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.940
A0 is greater than
equilibrium.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.290
And if you start below, you're
going to come up like this.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.800
A0 is less than A equilibrium.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.210
And both rates come into here,
in a very simple way.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.300
Just the sum of the two.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:22.090
So experimental, if you want to
find out these rates, you

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:27.750
can measure their equilibrium
concentrations.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:34.370
Measure k equilibrium by
obtaining the equilibrium

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:39.350
concentrations of B and A. And
that gives you the ratio of k1

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.850
plus k minus one.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.930
And then you can just start
the process with some

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.380
concentration of A. Which is
different in equilibrium.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:55.350
Then watching it in time,
extract out, observe and

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.600
measure k1 plus k minus one.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.960
In this kinetic equation.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.570
At kinetic relation.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:06.330
And then you have two results,
two pieces of data.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.610
You've measured k prime, which
gives you the sum of the two.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.490
And you've measured K
equilibrium, which gives you

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.660
the ratio of the two.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.250
And you've got your two
rate constants out.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:21.020
OK, any questions for the
equilibrium problem?

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.550
We're slowly -- yes.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:27.870
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.990
PROFESSOR: There is not yet
a relationship between

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.110
k1 and k minus one.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:38.170
It depends on the problem.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:45.470
And we're going to study the,
when we get to potential

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:52.570
barriers, we look at, we'll
look at this issue.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.800
OK, it's a good question.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.110
We're going to do that
probably next time.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.190
So let's get going, then, with
reversible reactions.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.910
So now we have, let's make it a
little bit more complicated.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.760
Let's, instead of two species,
let's make it three species.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:14.010
So we have A plus B goes to C,
where the rate constant k1,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:22.200
and then C goes to A plus to B
with a rate constant k minus

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:31.720
one that you can rewrite as A
plus B goes to C, k1, k minus

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.850
one, and then you write down
your, you want to solve this.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.760
So the first thing you do
is your write down your

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.680
differential equations. dA/dt is
equal to, put all the rates

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:50.040
in there. k1 A B minus k minus
one times C. And at

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:57.940
equilibrium, we set that
equal to zero.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.670
So you can write equilibrium
here, equilibrium here,

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.630
equilibrium here.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:11.980
And when you bring this term
over to the other side, you

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:17.380
find, then that at equilibrium
the ratio of the forward rate

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:22.320
to the backward rates is equal
to C equilibrium divided by A

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.750
equilibrium.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.840
The equilibrium, which,
you know is

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.590
the equilibrium constant.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.800
So again, for this slightly more
complicated problem, the

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.920
ratio of the forward and
backward rates are related to

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:39.220
the equilibrium constant.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.150
So now you want to solve this.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.790
Well, we're not even
going to try.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.810
Because it's going to
be too complicated.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.540
So as soon as you get away from
first order kinetics and

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.200
go to second order kinetics
with multiple

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.860
steps, it's a mess.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.090
So instead you try to
find approximations.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.880
In this case here there's
one we can use.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.910
Or a limiting case, at least.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:04.830
One we can use, which
is an obvious

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.110
one, which is flooding.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.000
As a limiting case.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.640
If we want to isolate a small
part of the problem, we can

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.580
use flooding.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:22.490
Because we can overwhelm the
system with either A or B.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:27.280
Take B0 much greater
than A0 and C0.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.070
So over the course of the
reaction of the process, the

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:33.170
concentration of B
hardly changes.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:37.430
And so when we write our kinetic
equation, our rate

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:45.730
law, k1 A B minus k minus one
C, we could put a little

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.890
naught here, because
we know the

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.270
concentration of B is not changing.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.260
And so now we're left with the
problem we had before.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.220
Which was a reversible first
order process which we have

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.210
just solved.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:04.340
And you go through the
experiment and you extract out

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.680
k1 times B0 and k minus one.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.990
You do the experiment again with
a different concentration

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:12.430
of B0 to start out with.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.650
And you can extract out k1.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.940
So this is a process of getting
the rates by using a

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.530
simple approximation here.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:26.950
Simple limiting case.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:30.030
Any questions?

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.790
So we've just finished putting
all the building blocks

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.630
together now.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:43.630
Let me remind you what these
building blocks are.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.870
We have a bunch of
approximations under our belt.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:52.960
Flooding, we've looked
at rates being

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.310
much faster than others.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:25:01.260
And we have three simple
mechanisms, we've looked at

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.810
parallel reactions.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:06.660
We looked at series reactions.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:13.220
And we've looked at reversible
reactions.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.340
So a complicated mechanism will
basically put these three

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.210
building blocks together
in a series.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.960
And they'll all be happening
at the same time somehow.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.890
And obviously, since it was,
since we threw up our hands,

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.540
just with a simple reversible
process like here, it's clear

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.670
that we're going to throw
up our hands a lot.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.270
When we write down
these mechanisms.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.510
So we're going to need
approximations.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.090
We're going to need something
that we'll automatically go

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.530
to, and say this is going
to be too hard.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.880
I'm not even going to try.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.380
Let's do an approximation.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.300
And two approximations that
we're going to talk about are

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.570
ones I already mentioned
at the beginning.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:01.810
Which is the steady state
approximation, where one rate,

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:07.055
the rate to go into the
intermediate is very slow, or

00:26:07.055 --> 00:26:10.680
the rate to get out of the
intermediate is very fast.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.040
And the equilibrium
approximation where the system

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.920
sets up a very fast equilibrium
and you're allowed

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.650
to use thermodynamics
to help you out

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.550
in solving the problem.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.700
These are the two approximations
that we'll use

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.920
when we put these
things together.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.480
OK, so let's look at the
first, simple, more

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.040
complicated mechanism.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.300
To see where these
approximations come in.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.310
So the first one is going
to be a series.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.130
We're going to start putting
these things together.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.300
First one is a series
reversible.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.740
Those two together.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:46.620
Series reversible.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.750
So we have first, a reversible
process.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.430
Everything is first order here.
k minus one goes to B.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.670
And then B goes to C with
some rate constant

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:01.130
k2, all first order.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.090
If we were to turn the crank,
we'd say, oh, I've got to

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.650
write down all my
rate laws here.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.200
Minus dA/dt is all the ways that
I destroy and create B,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:17.990
so there's a k1 times A minus
k minus one times B. dB/dt,

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:22.225
all the ways that create and
destroy B is that you create

00:27:22.225 --> 00:27:26.730
it through destruction of A.
I destroy it through the

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.700
backwards rate to make A. And
I destroy it by making the

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.290
product, C. There's
the intermediate.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.130
And then for C, that's
pretty simple.

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.660
There's only one channel into C,
and that's the destruction

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.110
of B to form C, k2 B.
All the rate laws.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.400
I write everything
I know here.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.290
Couple of differential
equations.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:52.410
We know it's going to
be hard to solve.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:58.640
So, let's remind ourselves
of what I just erased.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:09.700
Which was the case where the
intermediate concentration was

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.130
always very small and didn't
change very fast.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:20.140
And the process was dominated
by k1 here.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.040
That was the rate
limiting step.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:29.260
Remember that our first
example this morning.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:34.750
So this is where the
concentration of B is roughly

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.800
constant over time.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.190
It's small.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:45.950
And over any small time period,
it's roughly constant.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:52.210
Which means that dB/dt is
roughly equal to zero.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.320
If you look at a long term,
obviously it's going to change

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.060
as you go from this point
to that point.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.640
In fact, there's a relationship
between A which

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.600
is changing in time and B. But
A is also changing in time

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.240
very slowly.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.270
Because the rate k1
is very small.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.910
So dB/dt, which is related to
this rate k1, is going to be

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.120
very slowly changing in time.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:16.470
We can approximate it at zero.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.850
What are the ways in terms of
matching these rate constants

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.120
that we can get to the
approximation.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:28.180
To a diagram that
looks like that?

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:34.730
But we don't want
B to pile up.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.670
That means we have to have the
rates out of the intermediate

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.810
to be much faster, at least one
of the rates out of the

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:44.070
intermediate to be much faster
than the rate that creates the

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:45.690
intermediate.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.780
So the different ways of
creating that approximation

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.350
are if, and the length of the
arrows now is going to be

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.360
proportional to the rate.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.900
We want it to be very hard to
make B. And as soon as we make

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.830
B, we want it to go away.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.490
So one of the ways to do that
is to have the reverse rate

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.450
much faster than the
initial rate.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.660
And we could have a slow rate
into C, that's fine.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.900
We could have, again, a very
slow rate into B. We could

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.060
have a slow reverse rate
and a fast rate into

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.150
C. Perfectly fine.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.680
We could have both.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:28.790
Fast rate out of B through A, or
out of B through C. As long

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.240
as this first rate into the B
is small compared to one of

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.795
those two rates, we're never
going to pile up B. It's going

00:30:33.795 --> 00:30:37.140
to go away as soon
as we make it.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:42.380
So in all these cases, k2
plus k minus one is

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.770
much bigger than k1.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.980
When we have that situation,
then we can make the

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.800
approximation up here.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.180
That the rate of change
in B is very small.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.410
Almost zero, which means it's
basically a constant.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:31:01.130
And instead of writing B in this
case here, we're going to

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.670
write it as B steady state.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.270
Which is basically a constant
in terms of solving the

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.370
differential equations.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:14.090
And that's going to make
our life much easier.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:19.540
Because instead of having
to solve these coupled

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.230
differential equations, we're
just going to have to solve

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.450
coupled algebraic equations.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:29.140
Which is really messy,
but less hard.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:34.460
If you're a bean-counter
than this is heaven.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.240
So now we're going to put steady
state, this is going to

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.260
be a constant.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.660
And this is going to
be equal to zero.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.940
And then here this is going
to be steady state here.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.910
This is going to be
steady state here.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.420
And the first thing to do now is
that we've eliminated this

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.980
differential equation.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:57.780
We now have an algebraic
equation where we can solve

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.830
for B steady state.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:07.260
So if you recognize that you're
in this situation here,

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.380
forget about trying to solve.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.340
Immediately go to the process
of putting in a constant for

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.530
B. Setting dB/dt for the
intermediate equal to zero.

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:22.020
And then starting to turn the
crank on the algebra.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:26.580
So let me go ahead and
turn the crank here.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.620
Go through the steps,
which is basically

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:37.010
typical of these problems.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.350
So you turn the crank.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.960
You solve for the steady
state concentration.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:50.220
You get, in terms of A, over
k minus one, plus k2.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:55.410
Then you plug this
back in here.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:33:01.180
And you get a new differential
equation, minus dA/dt is equal

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:06.636
to k1 times A minus k minus one
times B steady state, so

00:33:06.636 --> 00:33:09.340
we plug this in here.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.000
And you get, so there's
A sitting here.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.190
A sitting here.

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:16.660
It's going to be of the form,
effective rate times A. It's

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.700
going to be basically
a first order form.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.400
Which is what we'd expect
from sketching the

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.050
diagram just like that.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:31.560
So you get minus dA/dt is an
effective rate. k1 times k2

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.330
over k1 plus k2.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:39.900
Times A. This is k prime.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.810
So if you were to do an
experiment under these

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:47.370
conditions, you'd find that A
behaves, it's basically a

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.750
pseudo first order problem.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:53.250
With a funny rate that contains
all the elementary

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.690
rate constants as part of it.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:59.990
And when you do the same thing
for C, dC/dt, you find that

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:05.410
depends on A. It's k1, you plug
these steady states in

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:11.250
here. k1 k2 divided by
k1 plus k2 times A.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.500
This is k prime again.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.050
So the problem, and
it's first order.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:18.930
So the problem looks like
effectively you're going from

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.710
A to C. Forget about
the intermediate.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.270
With an effective
rate k prime.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:30.070
Where k prime contains
these rates.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.310
So this is steady state
approximation.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:36.420
It's the prototypical problem.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.990
Questions on steady state,
before we go to the next

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:44.340
approximation.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:44.690
Alright.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:53.240
So now, as promised, the next
approximation is that where

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.890
are set up the fast
equilibrium.

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:59.180
And you can use thermo
to help you out.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:11.250
Equilibrium approximation
A goes to B.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:13.740
This is a fast process.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:21.030
And then k2 out of B
is a slow process.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:24.220
Little arrow here, and
two big arrows here.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.480
You put your A in your flask.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.230
Immediately you set up
the equilibrium.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.540
And you slowly dribble
out of that.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:40.130
If you want to do it as a
function of buckets and, so

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.950
you have a big pipe connecting
two buckets that are just

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:43.820
offset from each other.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:48.510
So there's, in this case here
B is favored over A. Because

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.260
it's a little bit lower
than this guy here.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.880
And then there's a little
bucket, there's a little tube,

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.870
comes out of here.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:02.710
So there's a little dribble
into C over time.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.340
First thing that happens is you
set up your equilibrium.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.690
And then you slowly extract
stuff through a little tube

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.280
into C.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.410
So what do you expect
this to look like?

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:22.770
Well, you expect A to really
slowly come out.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:27.690
Because the rate limiting step
is the rate from B to C. So k2

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.540
is going to be the way that
A is going to come out.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.340
You expect it to
slowly go away.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.220
You expect B to get created
very fast, to

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.550
some equilibrium amount.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:40.770
And then also to follow
the same rate

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.230
k2, slow k2, to disappear.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:48.700
And you expect C to come up.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.190
You're basically in a first
order process to

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.710
saturation of A0.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:56.240
So when you expect the dominant
rate to be k2, and

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.380
the fast dynamics to happen at
very, very early times, and

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:05.090
then everything to follow
first order kinetics.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.140
So now let's do the math and
make sure that it agrees with

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.400
what we've just assumed that
it's going to look like.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.280
So equilibrium is happening.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:19.000
You can assume that at any time
after the initial very

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.610
fast process of getting
equilibrium.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:25.420
So after some initial time,
the ratio of B over A is

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.430
always going to be a constant.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:31.560
The dribble out of B here is not
going to be fast enough to

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.010
change that ratio.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:39.280
As soon as you get a little bit
of B out here, immediately

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.720
the ratios, the amounts
rearrange to

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.460
keep the ratio constant.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:48.120
So now when I look at the rate
of the reaction, the rate of

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:54.780
formation of C, k2 times B,
well, in terms of A, it's k2

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.050
times K equilibrium.

00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:07.020
Times A. Which is k2 times k1
over k minus one times A. And

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.800
you can immediately see that C
is behaving, or the reaction

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.650
is behaving, like a first
order process.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.260
With an effective rate which
contains all three rates in

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:23.150
this ratio here.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.140
So it looks like A goes to C,
with some k prime where this

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.640
is k prime.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.480
It looks like A goes to
C with an effective

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.280
rate constant k prime.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:36.820
OK.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.100
Questions?

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.510
We're going to do
some examples.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.980
And then we're going to do chain
reactions next time.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:50.000
We're one lecture behind.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.330
Alright.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:53.020
Let's do some reactions.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:39:01.530
Some examples.

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:05.800
I'm going to skip the first
example, which is the example

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.260
with the chaperone,
in the notes.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:12.350
And I'm going to go directly
to the gas decomposition.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.750
The two examples are basically
very similar in their use of

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.700
the steady state
approximation.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.820
So I'll let you read over
the first example.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.120
So this example here is going
to give us the Lindemann

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.720
mechanism, for which Mr.
Lindemann got a Nobel Prize

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.530
many many, years ago.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.820
Basically, it's looking
at decomposition

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:44.910
of a gas phase molecule.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:47.350
Where you have a molecule,
A, that

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:52.280
breaks down into products.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:40:01.460
And the observation before Mr.
Lindemann got around, was that

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:06.410
it looked like a first
order process.

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:10.670
It looked like A is just falling
apart on its own into

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.320
these products.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.180
Mr. Lindemann got around and
said, well, why would A just

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.420
want to fall apart.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.040
There's something a little
bit odd about that.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.600
Stable molecule, why would
it want to fall apart.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:29.270
And so he hypothesized
a mechanism.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:33.040
And it went like this.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.270
That A actually collides with
another molecule, which could

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.530
be a bystander.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.080
Could be a chaperone molecule
that just happens to be there.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:42.930
Or it could be another
molecule of

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:46.110
A. There's a collision.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:50.210
There's a collision that
creates a vibrationally

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.560
excited version of A.
Of A sitting there.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:53.970
It collides.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:56.850
It suddenly starts to be really
vibrationally excited.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.840
Bonds vibrate all
over the place.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.670
Atoms wiggle.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.040
There's the collision partner
that goes away.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:08.870
So kinetic energy is transferred
from M and A to

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:14.240
the vibrational loads of A. In a
process which is reversible.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.020
k1, k minus one, because this
excited A, this vibrationally

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.880
excited A, could also collide
with a molecule and cool down.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.850
The energy in the vibrations
could be transferred back to

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:29.120
kinetic energy for a
reverse process.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.980
But if you wait long enough,
or if this vibrationally

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:39.000
excited A, with these atoms
widely moving around, that has

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.700
more of a chance of falling
apart than this guy here.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:49.160
So A star could fall apart
into products.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.010
With a rate k2.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.860
So he said, this is actually
an important step.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.800
It's not that A just suddenly
falls apart.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.520
But this has to happen.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.990
So all the observations that
supported a first order

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:05.960
process, which basically only
supported one elementary

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:13.230
reactions, might not be right.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:16.870
So let's assume his mechanism,
and let's look at what we need

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.800
to do as an approximation.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.930
And where that leads us
in terms of trying to

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:28.320
experimentally confirm that this
mechanism is plausible.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.830
Not prove it, but just to make
sure that it's consistent

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:43.230
with, the data's consistent
with the hypothesis.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:50.390
So let's compare
our rates here.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:51.530
So we have a collision.

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:55.230
A and M collide, and there's a
certain probability on the

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:59.280
collision that kinetic energy
will be transferred to

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.100
vibrational energy.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.870
That turns out to be a
moderate probability.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:09.950
So k1 is reasonably fast.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:11.870
The reverse process, you have
something that's vibrationally

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:14.610
excited colliding
with a molecule.

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.700
There's a probability that that
excitation is going to

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.320
get turned back into
kinetic energy.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.760
And then these two molecules
will fly

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.460
apart with high velocity.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.690
And that tends to be much
more highly probable

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:28.070
then the first process.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.810
So this is faster.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:32.950
Then the excited molecule's
waiting around.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.380
And there's a probability that
there's it's going to just

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.900
fall apart.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.700
And that turns out to
be really slow.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:49.330
So we're going to assume that
the last step is a slow step.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:50.680
So what does it look like?

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.895
Well, we have the creation
is fast.

00:43:55.895 --> 00:43:57.420
So the intermediate is fast.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.160
But the destruction through
the reverse

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.340
process is much faster.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.280
We have at least one step, out
of the intermediate, which is

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.190
faster than the step into
the intermediate.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.480
That's all we care about.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.050
It doesn't really matter that
this is slow in terms of using

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.550
the steady state
approximation.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:17.075
We just want the step getting
out of the intermediate, a

00:44:17.075 --> 00:44:20.470
backwards step in this case
here, to be faster than the

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:22.730
state into the intermediate.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:26.080
So this allows this, this fact
that this is faster, that

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:30.250
allows us to use a steady
state approximation.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.020
So now we can go ahead and
solve the problem.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:38.130
So we write down all the
rates minus dA/dt.

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:46.170
It's k1 A. Let's start with
the rate of the action.

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:47.390
Let's take a product.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:50.050
Let's take C. Let's say this
goes to product C here.

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:55.410
So dC/dt is equal to
k2 times A, that's

00:44:55.410 --> 00:45:00.110
the rate of the reaction.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.330
And we're going to look at
this rate of reaction.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:04.650
And see how it changes.

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.830
What it looks like under
limiting conditions.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:13.990
The rate of reaction.

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:15.220
Let's look at the
intermediate.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.940
Because this is what we're going
to solve first, because

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.660
this is going to turn out to
be an algebraic equation.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.550
Because we're going to apply
the steady state

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.080
approximations.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:28.656
Intermediate d A star / dt is,
we can create it through the

00:45:28.656 --> 00:45:30.430
forward process.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.400
We destroy it through the
backwards process.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.930
A star times M. And we destroy
it through the final process.

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.840
A star.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.390
We apply the steady state
approximation, steady state,

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:46.530
steady state.

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:55.180
We solve for A steady state
algebraically. k1 A M over M

00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:00.960
times k minus 1 plus k2.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.330
And then we plug that back into
the rate of the reaction.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:06.530
The rate of appearance of C.
Which is what we're measuring

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:07.140
experimentally.

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.850
We're looking at the products.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.240
Measuring the appearance
of products.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.170
So they're destruction.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:21.920
This is also equal to the
destruction of A.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:31.300
And so we plug this into the, we
write our rate of reaction.

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.340
Which we measure,
experimentally.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.860
We find this is k1 times k2.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:42.640
Times, we plug in for, and
here, what we do here, we

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:48.030
solve A in terms of
A steady state.

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:53.330
A is equal to something
A steady state.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:47:04.210
Well, let's see, A is equal to
M k minus one plus k2 times,

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.545
well this is actually,
I have this wrong up

00:47:06.545 --> 00:47:11.670
here, this is d A star.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.600
So we don't need to
do this here.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.590
The appearance of C
is, A star here.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:24.740
So we plug in A steady
state here.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:29.325
A star steady state, and this
is A star steady state.

00:47:29.325 --> 00:47:36.270
The intermediate is what we're
solving a steady state for.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:43.900
So this is k1 k2 A M over
M k minus one plus k2.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:48.130
We just have the extra k2 that
appears when we multiply A

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:52.330
steady state star with
the k2 there.

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.590
And then we can look at
the limiting cases.

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:58.920
There are two limiting cases,
which we can tell by looking

00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.410
at the denominator.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.850
If we have one term bigger
than the other.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.520
Only two choices here.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:07.270
So the first case is where
M k minus one is

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:10.320
much bigger than k2.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.630
Experimentally, what
does that mean?

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.320
It means that this in
the gas phase now.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.560
It means that regardless of
what these rates are here,

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.790
we've managed to make the
concentration of M high enough

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.980
so that this becomes true.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.310
There's always an M that's going
to be high enough so

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.600
that the multiplication of
these two is going to be

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.050
bigger than that.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:29.910
What does that mean?

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:33.180
It means that the pressure
is high.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.680
Concentration of M is high.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:40.020
This is a high pressure case.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.400
And then the other one
is M k minus one is

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.730
much less than k2.

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.820
M is very small.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:51.210
Low concentration,
low pressure.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.910
The partial pressure
of M is very low.

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:57.220
This could be A. M could be A,
or it could be some other

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.720
molecule that's in the mix.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.080
And by high pressure we mean
something on the order of one

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.990
bar, let's say.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:07.350
That by low pressure we mean
something around 10 to the

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:12.410
minus 4 bar.

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:16.850
So now we can go and put these
limiting cases in our equation

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:20.120
here. k minus one is much bigger
than k2, so we can

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.970
ignore k2 here.

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:23.280
And then we have something
that looks

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.380
like the M's disappear.

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:31.880
We have something that looks
like k1 k2 over k minus one

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:37.120
times A is the rate
of reaction.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.030
First order.

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:39.380
Looks like it's first
order in A. This is

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.600
what people had observed.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.380
Great.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:43.810
The problem is that
they didn't know

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:45.860
to go to low pressure.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.290
They were doing all
their experiments

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:49.340
at atmospheric pressure.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.700
They were getting a
first order rate.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.310
They thought they had
solved the problem.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.590
It's just A falling
apart by itself.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:58.350
Until you go to low pressure,
where now this term dominates

00:49:58.350 --> 00:49:59.630
the denominator.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:03.690
Or rather, this one dominates
the denominator.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:12.740
And now you have something of
the form k1 A times M. This

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.830
dominates, this term
goes away.

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:19.760
The k2 goes away and you have
k1 times A times M left over

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:25.270
as the rate of the reaction.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.970
Second order.

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:27.040
There are two species here.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.290
A times M. M could be A or it
could be some chaperone.

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:31.290
A squared.

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:33.000
Second order process.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.790
So if you're at low
pressure, you see

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:35.740
something at second order.

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.630
You've discovered something
about the mechanisms you

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:39.210
didn't expect.

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:42.130
And then you get
a Nobel Prize.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.490
Alright, next time we'll
do chain reactions.
