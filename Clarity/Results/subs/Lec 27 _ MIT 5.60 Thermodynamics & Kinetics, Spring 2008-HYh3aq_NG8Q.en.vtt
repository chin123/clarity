00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.660
PROFESSOR: And last time, you
got to see how you can derive

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.640
macroscopic thermodynamic
results from the microscopic

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.790
point of view of statistical
mechanics.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.800
So in contrast to the way we'd
gone through the course from

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.030
the beginning, starting from
empirical macroscopic

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.920
observation and ideas through
macroscopic laws and then

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.330
working out the consequences
of them, in statistical

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.710
mechanics you start from a
microscopic model, build up

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.910
the energy levels that are going
to give you the terms in

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.310
the partition function,
determine the partition

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.910
function, and what you saw last
time is that given that,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.190
you can calculate everything.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.730
You can calculate all the
macroscopic properties that

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.200
ordinarily come from the
thermodynamic laws that were

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.080
based on empirical macroscopic
observation.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.810
So today, I just want to
continue doing some

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.360
statistical thermodynamics.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.330
Basically going through a few
examples, just to see how it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.950
plays out when we calculate
thermodynamic quantities,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.880
based on our microscopic
picture.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:32.570
So let's just look
at a few cases.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.640
And I'll start with a couple of
examples that are entirely

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.690
entropy driven.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.290
And we've seen them
before from the

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.760
macroscopic point of view.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.600
What we should hope, of course,
is that we can derive

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.910
those results from the partition
functions that are

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.010
appropriate here.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:57.100
So, we'll look at entropically
driven processes.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.240
And the first one, the simplest
one, maybe, to cover,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.280
is just free expansion
of a gas.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.920
So what happens if we've got
particles in a gas that are

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.370
enclosed in a certain volume.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.890
And now we let the volume expand
into vacuum on the

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.370
other side.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.520
Of course, you know
what'll happen.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.140
The volume will be filled
and we've derived the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.710
thermodynamics for it before.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.830
So let's see what happens in a

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.550
statistical mechanical treatment.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.320
So let's say, here's V1,
there's our gas.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.830
There's vacuum.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.240
And now we'll open it up and
just have the bigger volume,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.460
V2, and let the gas fill it.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.410
So I think last time you got
introduced to basically a

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.470
lattice model for translational
motion.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.610
And I started in on this
just a little bit

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.060
the time before also.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.160
So this is a simple way to
describe the statistical

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.480
mechanics of filling
an open volume.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.410
Filling a space with
molecules.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.540
And all it does is say that
we're going to divide up our

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.700
available volume into little
bits that are basically the

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.930
size of an atom or a molecule,
or whatever the particle is in

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.370
the gas phase.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.160
And say, OK, there are maybe
10 of the 30th of

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.340
those little volumes.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.750
The little volume elements are
going to be on the order of an

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.840
angstrom cubed if it's an atom,
a little bit bigger if

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.690
it's a molecule.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.100
And the available volume is on
the order of meters cubed.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.810
So that works out, an angstrom
is 10 to the minus 10 meters.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.170
And then the cube of that
is 10 to the minus 30th.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.540
So if you look at the total
number of little volume

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.370
elements of this sort, it's on
the order of 10 to the 30th.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:55.850
So, the total volume, capital
V, let's make

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.830
that distinction clear.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.230
And in this case, all the states
of the system have

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.570
equal energies.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.850
So in other words, it doesn't
matter we're dividing our

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:17.300
volume up into imagined little
volume elements.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.080
And for both the molecular and
the system states, the energy

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.490
is the same.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.960
It doesn't matter whether the
molecules are here, here, here

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.160
and so forth.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.740
They're not interacting in
this picture at all.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.440
So it doesn't matter how
close or far they

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.340
are from each other.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.590
They can't be in the
same volume.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.310
So all the energies
are the same.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.860
And what that means is, in the
partition function, which is a

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.880
sum over all these terms with
these Boltzmann factors.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.920
That have e to the minus
energy over kT.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.810
But energy's all the same in
every one of the terms.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.200
So in order to determine the
partition function, to

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.890
determine Q, all we have to do
is count up the total number

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.170
of states that are available.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.740
So, our energy, our molecular
translational energy, we'll

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.270
just set it to zero.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.830
Same with our system
translational energy.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.980
We'll set that to zero.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.320
All the microscopic available
states, that is, if I take an

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.630
individual particle and I say
where it can be, all those

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.410
states have the same energy.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.760
If I take a microstate of the
system, you know, the whole

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.290
collection of the particles, all
of those states also have

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.920
the same energy.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.490
So what that means is that
little q is just equal to

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.030
capital V over little
v, right?

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.320
How many states are there?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.450
Well, I've got my little volume,
and then however many

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.340
individual cells there are,
that's the number of available

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.090
states in this model.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.710
So it's big V over little
v, on the order

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.060
of 10 to the 30th.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.820
And then, big Q, the canonical
partition function for the

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.070
whole system, it's something
that we've

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.240
been through before.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.190
It's this process of saying,
well, you take the first atom

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.940
or molecule, and it has any one
of these possible states.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.270
So it's on the order of 10 to
the 30th possibilities.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.720
Then where does the
second one go?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.490
Well, there are basically
10 to the 30th more

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.360
possibilities.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.420
And the third one has
10 to the 30th.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.480
Since there are so many fewer
atoms or molecules then there

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.500
are volume elements, when we're
dealing with the gas

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.780
phase, we don't have to worry
about the fact that, well the

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.070
first million of the atoms
filled some of the sites.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.160
So the next ones have fewer
sites available to them.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.200
It's true, but it's such a small
fraction that are ever

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.070
filled that we don't need
to worry about it.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.780
So Q is just little q to
the capital N power,

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.350
the number of particles.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.610
And then we've seen you have
to divide by N factorial to

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.900
avoid the overcounting of
configurations that are in

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.820
fact not distinguishable.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.190
The whole idea that maybe
there's an atom here and

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.420
another one here.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.990
That configuration is
indistinguishable from the

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.000
configuration with those two
atoms reversed if we're

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.780
dealing with a mole of
identical atoms.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.640
So, OK.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.460
There's our capital Q. And
that's also our system

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.120
degeneracy.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.990
So the degeneracy, the little
g for the molecular

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.030
degeneracy, how many molecular
states are there

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.100
of a certain energy.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.780
Well, it's the same
thing as q.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.130
And it's the same thing here
for the system states.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:49.900
The capital Omega is
just equal to that.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:55.400
Well, now let's look at what
happens when we do this.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.400
When we expand from volume
V1 to volume V2.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.270
So that capital V is
going to change.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:10.230
So capital V1 goes
to capital V2.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.780
And we know it's entropically
driven.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.760
Let's calculate the
change in entropy.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:26.160
So delta S is just k log capital
Omega 2 minus k log

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.540
capital Omega 1.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.720
Now, in the process of just
seeing how the development

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.330
goes, how you can derive all
these thermodynamic quantities

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.050
from the partition function, one
of the really most central

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.740
results concerns the entropy.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.040
How you can describe the
entropy in terms of the

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.760
probabilities that the different
states are occupied.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.320
And how, in the case like this,
where the states all

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.800
have the same probability of
being occupied, then you have

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.030
this very simplified form
for the entropy.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.680
Just, if S is k log capital
Omega, where capital Omega is

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.090
the degeneracy.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:06.220
The number of system states
of that energy.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.960
An amazing result.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.440
You told them about Boltzmann's

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.270
tombstone and so forth.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.650
So it's on there.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:20.440
In fact, the ill acceptance of
that result kind of led to the

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.460
tombstone being erected
when it did.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.050
Boltzmann, depressed over the
lack of acceptance of his

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.270
theories, put himself
to an early death.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.540
And this was off a big
part of the reason.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.140
But we, generations later,
have come to accept the

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.560
results that concerned
him so deeply.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.620
So this is our change in
entropy, when we just have

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.100
this expansion of gas
from V1 to V2.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:52.220
So it's just k log
omega 2, omega 1.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.850
So now let's just put in our
results for the volumes.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:04.560
It's k log V2 over v, I'm
exaggerating the size there.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:11.050
To the N, over N factorial,
over V1 over v to the N

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.530
divided by N factorial.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.180
So this is going to turn out
to be a relatively simple

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.840
case, because the factorials
are going to cancel.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:28.700
So, then we just have
N k, log V2 over V1.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.670
Terrific, right?

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.410
Now, remember, k, the Boltzmann
constant, is just

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:39.260
the ideal gas constant per
molecule rather than per mole.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.160
So this is the same thing as
little N, the number of moles,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:49.090
times R, times log V2 over V1.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.060
And that should be a
familiar result.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.870
That's the change in entropy in
expansion, free expansion

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.960
of a gas, from V1 to V2.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.500
So now we've been able to derive
that just based on this

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.960
really simple molecular
picture.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.530
Based on that plus the result
that Boltzmann fought and paid

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.600
so dearly for, so that
we would have it

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.960
and understand it.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.200
As before, of course note
it's greater than zero.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.300
If the volume, if we're
expanding into a bigger volume

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.490
than before.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.440
The entropy goes up.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.240
Also notice one of the other
results that you've seen is

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.420
that you could relate
the partition

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.930
function to A, right?

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:43.090
The Helmholtz free energy is
minus k T log Q. And S is

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.340
negative dA/dT.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.910
And so this would immediately
give us the same result,

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.170
because omega's going
to go in here.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.210
So we could get this result from
another pathway, too, but

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.890
a more simple and direct way is
just to start directly from

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.330
the Boltzmann result
for entropy.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.930
Any questions?

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.080
Alright, let's go one
step more complex.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.110
Let's now look at the
entropy of mixing.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.050
So now we've got two species.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.900
Rather than one expanding into a
free volume, and we're going

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.860
to open a barrier between
them and see them mix.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.930
And again, it's still
entropically driven.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.880
And we should be able to
calculate the entropy change

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.100
that we saw before from a
macroscopic perspective.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:39.000
So, let's take a look.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:48.300
So now, we have NA molecules
of A in some volume VA.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.530
And NB molecules of B,
in some volume VB.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.070
And then we're going
to open it up.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.940
Then we've got capital
N, NA plus NB.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:11.180
And capital V. VA
plus VB, right?

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.450
And the whole thing is

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:19.290
happening at constant pressure.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:24.070
Well, then let's look at the
initial and final expressions

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.160
for the entropy.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.290
So, S1, at the beginning.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:44.600
It's just k log omega A plus k
log omega B. And that's k log

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.850
VA over little v to
the NA power.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:58.730
Divided by NA factorial times
the same thing for B. VB over

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:05.770
little v to the NB power
over NB factorial.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.640
So that's our initial entropy.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.230
The sum of the two entropy
contributions,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.380
from the two sides.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:20.340
And S2, the final one,
is just k log omega

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.780
for the whole shebang.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.060
And that's k log.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:33.300
And now we have capital V over
little v to the N power.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.870
And now we have a combinatorics
result that I

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.020
think probably you're all
familiar with from one context

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.890
or another.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:44.400
That is, now we have
to divide by NA

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:52.770
factorial times NB factorial.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:56.300
In other words, the amount that
we need to divide by to

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.680
avoid overcounting is the
product of those two

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.810
factorials.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.380
Just in case it's been a while
since you've seen stuff like

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.350
that, I've got a couple of pages
further on the notes at

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.590
the bottom of the page.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.860
I've just broken that out for a
really simple example where

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.680
there are just two molecules of
A, and two molecules of B

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:22.250
represented by different little
balls in lattice sites.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.630
And I just worked it out for the
total where there are only

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:29.030
ten total in the mixture.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.150
The point is, now what happens
is, when you start filling a

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.560
lattice, but it's not
all the same, right?

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.430
So now you have A here.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.480
And A here.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.520
And B here.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.720
And B here.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.850
So, of course if you interchange
A and B here, you

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.180
don't have an identical state.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.410
An indistinguishable state.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.950
That's distinguishable and
needs to be counted.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.470
It's only interchanging B with
B that you need to correct

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:01.770
for, and interchanging A with
A. So of course you need to

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.610
account for that in a way that's
different from how it

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:10.380
turns out if every one of the
molecules is identical.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.680
So it's the product of
these factorials.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.130
In the numerator.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:29.910
So now delta S is then
just this minus this.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:48.390
So it's k log V over little v
to the NA plus NB over VA

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:55.710
divided by little v to the NA
power VB divided by little v

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.220
to the NB power.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.770
And, let's see, maybe
I'd better back up.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.110
Let me know, that's all.

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.780
And what's happening is,
again, luckily, these

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.850
factorials are canceling.

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:25.910
So we just have k log V to the
NA, V to the NB over VA to the

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:33.340
NA VB to the NB.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.830
And now we're going to go back
and use the fact that the

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.840
pressures are the same,
all the way through.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.850
And what that means is that
the volumes must be in the

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:50.020
same ratio as the number
of molecules.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:56.300
And what that means is that, for
example, VA over V is the

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.380
same as NA over N. And that's
just equal to XA, the mole

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:07.780
fraction of A. And the
same for B. So we

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.680
can substitute that.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:21.360
And know our delta S just
becomes k log, let's see, let

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:27.700
me break this out from
the beginning.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:39.930
And just take minus k log on XA
to the NA power minus k log

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.250
XB to the NB power.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.130
All I've done make these
substitutions here.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.540
For the ratios of the volume.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:58.710
So it's just minus N k XA
log XA plus XB log XB.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.640
Look familiar?

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.120
Same thing we saw
macroscopically before.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.960
So, again, we can still use
our microscopic model.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.990
And continue to derive the
macroscopic entropy changes.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.410
And, of course, for many of
these we can still get our

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.040
delta G and so forth.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.740
Of course, it's only entropy
that's going to contribute.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.620
OK, let's look at just one more
entropy driven problem.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.980
And that is, it's a little
bit different from these.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.320
Let's look at the entropy
mixing in a liquid.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.070
And the difference between the
gas and the liquid is that in

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:42.330
the case of the liquid, every
single cell is filled.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.710
It's not like with the gas.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.815
And that makes a difference
in how the

00:19:45.815 --> 00:19:47.950
states need to be counted.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.160
Because here, remember how
I said when we were

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.280
filling this lattice.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.170
Well, the first molecules
goes somewhere.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.740
And there are 10 to the
30th possibilities.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.880
And the second molecule goes
somewhere and there are 10 to

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.750
the 30th possibilities.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.630
And there are always 10 to the
30th possibilities because

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.480
there's so few molecules that
you never have to worry about

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.360
the fact that it's getting
filled up, so there would

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:12.040
become fewer possibilities
for that last molecule.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.020
And the reason again is because
there are so few

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:19.640
molecules that essentially,
all the cells are open and

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.250
available even to the
last molecule.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.880
Because maybe there's
a mole of molecules.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.940
Maybe there are 10 to
the 24 molecules.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.150
And there are 10 to the
30th lattice sites.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.140
So there might be one in
a million lattice sites

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.370
occupied, even at the very
end of the procedure.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.470
But of course for the
liquid, that's

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.990
definitely not the case.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.070
All the available volume
is filled.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.940
So by the time you get to that
last molecule, it has one and

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.580
only one space it can go into.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.290
So you have to count for the
diminishment of the available

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:56.660
sites as molecules are
placed in them.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.470
OK.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:01.670
So it's a different kind
of combinatorics

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.020
problem that results.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.190
So, OK.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:12.620
Let's look at liquid mixture.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:22.140
So now, it's going
to look like, and

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:29.550
they're all filled up.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:39.865
I sure used fewer sites maybe,
but that'll be easier here.

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:43.910
We've got open circles.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.020
So these two are going to mix.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:52.950
And now we're going to
have filled mixture.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.350
So we're going to have a bigger
volume, but it's still

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.480
going to be filled and all
the positions are random.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.310
So we have to consider
all the possible

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.640
configurations that we have.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.510
OK.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.060
So we still should
go through the

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.110
same part of the procedure.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:16.710
So let's call this A. And this,
B. So at first, already

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.100
the situation is different.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:24.520
If we say what's the entropy
of system A. Well, in this

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.550
simple model the entropy of
the pure liquid is zero.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:32.600
Now, of course, that's
not realistic.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.650
But it's going to turn
out to be suitable.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.430
Because the change in
entropy that we go

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:38.630
from here to the mixture.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:42.120
The other contributions to
entropy are going to more or

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.480
less be the same from
beginning to end.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.680
What's going to be significantly
different is

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.040
simply the fact that in the
mixture you have the random

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.100
positions that can
be occupied.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.310
So that's going to be the term
that matters, the contribution

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.570
that matters.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:02.420
So entropy is just k log
Omega A. There's

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.760
only one system state.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.110
All of the lattice sites are
filled, and they're all filled

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.840
with A. So there's only
one way to do it.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.090
And of course, it doesn't
matter if

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:10.740
you interchange them.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.740
They're indistinguishable.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.650
So this is zero.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.320
This is one.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.820
There's only one state.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:27.430
Same, of course, for B.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:33.420
So that's our initial entropy
in this simple model.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.800
Well then, delta S
of the mixture is

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.900
just S of the mixture.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:45.220
We don't need to worry about
the original parts.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:51.080
Now, this is going to be k log
of N factorial over NA

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.460
factorial NB factorial, like
we've seen before.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.220
That's not different
from before.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.940
Except that unlike before, we
don't have the convenient and

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.440
simple cancellation
of the factorials.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.050
That happened before, because
they were there.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.290
In other words, they were
there in the entropy

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.880
contribution in the gas phase
as well, in the pure gas.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.160
They're only there here
in the liquid.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.290
And that means we have
to deal with them.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.610
But it turns out it's not too
bad to deal with them.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:31.230
And we're going to use this
Stirling's approximation that

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:32.810
I introduced before.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:42.240
So the log of N factorial is
approximately equal to N log N

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:48.700
minus N. So let's just break
that out then, and use the

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:53.620
Stirling's approximation for
each of the factorial terms.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:25:03.420
So then we have S for
the mixture is N k

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:09.230
log N minus N k minus.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:11.440
And now we'll do the bottom,
the numerator.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:20.460
NA k log NA minus NA times
k, that's this part.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.310
And now we'll do this one.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:31.010
So it's plus NB k log
NB minus NB times k.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:43.340
But NA and NB, of course, are
just N. So these will cancel.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:51.050
So then we're left with
NA plus NB times k

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.870
log N minus NA --

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.200
And I just want to write this
this way so that I can then

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.760
separate the terms.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:11.530
Minus NA k log NA minus
NB k log NB.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:16.430
And now I just want to combine
the easily combined terms.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:30.330
So it's NA k log N over NA
plus NB k log N over NB.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.980
Looks like we're home.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:45.520
Now we just have N k XA log
XA plus XB log XB right?

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.990
This NA over N is just XA.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:52.270
NB over is XB.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.200
And then I've divided the same
thing to make XA's over here.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.760
And take the total number
of moles out.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.880
Alright.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.480
Look familiar?

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.800
Again, the same thing derived
now in a way that's a bit

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.730
different from what we
did in the gas phase.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.620
So now I've got the entropy of
mixing even in a condensed

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.580
phase the liquid.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.670
And again, the reason this
simple model works is because

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:18.020
although a real liquid,
certainly a pure liquid has a

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.910
finite entropy, a substantial
amount of disorder, that's

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.590
present, that kind
of disorder.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.770
In other words, the fact that
you don't really have the

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.750
molecules sitting in sites on a

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.430
lattice but there's disorder.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:35.190
There's also rotational disorder
if it's a molecule.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.660
There are various contributions
to entropy.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.410
But those are all comparable
in the

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.180
starting and final states.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.320
The thing that's changed is
simply the interchanging of A

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.320
and B molecules.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.490
That's introduced a new kind of
disorder that didn't used

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.080
to be present.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.110
A very big difference in the
number of states at the end

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:57.350
from the beginning.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.480
And that's what we've calculated
and captured here.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.520
And that's why such a simple
model still works OK.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.860
Any questions about these
entropy driven cases?

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.350
OK.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.430
Now let's move on and talk about
the cases which are more

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:17.670
commonly encountered, where
the states aren't

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.290
all the same energy.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.970
Of course, here in the liquid,
just like in the gas, we

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:25.110
haven't treated interactions
between the molecules.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:28.010
We've assumed that they're equal
between A and B, as they

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.640
are between A and A and B and
B. So in this case then all

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.965
the energy to the states are
the same and it's just a

00:28:33.965 --> 00:28:34.900
counting problem.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.700
How many states are
there available.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.450
As soon as the energies are
different, then of course we

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:43.550
need to account for all those
Boltzmann factors.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:47.700
Those e to the minus energy over
kT factors become part of

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.940
the, they weight the counting.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:29:15.330
And we have to do that.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:20.510
So, what I want to do is go back
to this simple polymer

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:25.040
configurational model that
we introduced before.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.355
And this sort of model, in one
form or another, we're going

00:29:29.355 --> 00:29:34.190
to see a few times in the
rest of this treatment.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.680
The reason, really, is because
it's a simple and also

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:45.120
realistic way of portraying
a system that has a finite

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.090
number of well-defined
energies.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.520
If you don't have that,
of course you

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.810
could do the treatment.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:57.540
In a, sort of, classical
mechanic sense, a continuum of

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.050
states, all with different
energies.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.570
It's hard.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.370
Because then those sum in the
partition function become

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.040
integrals over all the different
configurations and

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:08.530
possibilities.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.720
It's much more complicated
to do.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.380
It's much more straightforward
if you can identify discrete

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.210
states and add over them.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:21.660
Now, someday you'll take
quantum mechanics.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.220
And then you'll see that the
states are discrete, even if

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.190
we're talking about
translation or

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.500
rotation and so forth.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.980
So you'll have discrete quantum
mechanical energy

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.050
levels and so forth.

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:35.770
You haven't had that yet.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.320
And so that's not the starting
point that we're going to use.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.670
Instead, we're going to use
a starting point that goes

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:44.290
through the exact same
formalism, which is just the

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.970
discrete states available in
molecules that have multiple

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.900
configurations.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:31:11.220
So we're going to have unequal
energy states.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:25.530
And what we're envisioning
is molecular or polymer

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.640
configurations.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:42.320
So here we have our states.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.130
And just like before, the idea
is that if you have two

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.310
sub-units that are in proximity,
there's some kind

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.520
of favorable interaction.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.450
It could be hydrogen bonding.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.290
Could be different.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:57.120
But the point is, there's some
sort of interaction there that

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:12.320
reduces the energy.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.490
And then there are other
configurations that

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.490
just don't have that.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:32.650
Because the sub-units aren't
in proximity to each other.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.960
And it's not hard to work out
that in this very simple

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.550
model, these are the only

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:39.530
configurations that are available.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.020
The only distinct
configurations.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:50.090
So then, our molecular energy,
E, we can define as zero here.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.530
Before we defined it as minus E
int, but I'm going to, it's

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.460
a little more convenient to make
this the zero of energy,

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:02.950
and then this is plus
the interaction for

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:04.830
each of these states.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:09.870
Of course, we can put the zero
of energy wherever we prefer.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:15.220
And then we have the
degeneracy is one.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:21.780
And in this case it's three.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:28.060
So now we can just write out the
configurational partition

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:33.040
function for the molecules and
also the canonical partition

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.770
function for the system.

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:39.470
So q configurational.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.980
And we're just going to
sum over the states.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:50.360
So it's e to the zero over
kT, for the lowest state.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.180
And then there are three states
that are going to have

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:58.410
this term, e to the minus E
interaction over kT, where E

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.510
int is a positive number.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.470
In other words, the probability
of any one of

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:06.170
these states is a little bit
lower than this state.

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:09.320
Because this state
has lower energy.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.580
Remember what I mentioned
earlier, which is although the

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.040
probability of any one of these
states is lower than the

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:21.740
probability of this state, the
probability of this energy is

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.300
likely to be higher than the
probability of this energy.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.450
Because there's only one
of these states and the

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:28.250
degeneracy here is three.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.370
So there are three possibilities
in which the

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:33.380
molecule could have this energy,
and only one this.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:39.880
So if, basically, kT is bigger
than E int, so in other words,

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.370
if this term isn't very much
smaller than one, then of

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:48.390
course this will be
bigger than this.

00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:51.120
So of course this is one
plus three e to the

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:59.950
minus E int over kT.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:05.490
And now we have our capital Q,
our canonical configurational

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.380
partition function.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.530
And that's just little q

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.160
configurational to the Nth power.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.140
And like you've seen so far,
in various cases where the

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.200
molecules are separate
non-interacting molecules,

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.950
this is just the molecular
partition function taken

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.730
capital N times.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.250
If all the molecules are
behaving independently, then

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.740
you sum over all of
those states.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.570
And you see that each
one of these is just

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.830
taken again and again.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:36.580
As we've seen implicitly
in all these

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.600
treatments so far as well.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.440
Now, in the translational
case where

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.970
you interchange particles.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.140
Like particles, you have to
divide by N factorial. .

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.070
But the different configurations
don't do that.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:53.220
If I've got a system where a
molecule over here is in this

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.210
configuration and a molecule
somewhere else is in this one,

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.470
and now they change
configurations, that's a

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.710
distinguishable state.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.240
So there's no N factorial
involved here.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.670
In the configurational
partition function.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:13.860
So, fine, then it's just one
plus three e to the minus E

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.770
int over kT to the Nth power.

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.810
That's Q. And once we know Q,
as you've seen, we know

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:22.970
everything.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:26.550
And so we can immediately start
in deriving all of the

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.770
thermodynamics, right?

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:33.300
And the place to start is A,
Helmholtz free energy, or

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.720
configurational free energy.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:40.410
Because that's the simplest
relation, just as minus kT log

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:46.550
of capital Q configurational.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:54.580
So it's minus N kT one
plus three e to the

00:36:54.580 --> 00:37:21.180
minus E int over kT.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.950
I'm going to rewrite A
configurational in terms of

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.270
beta rather than kT, just
because there are going to be

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:29.930
a lot of these factors.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:38.715
So it's minus N kT one plus
three e to the minus beta E

00:37:38.715 --> 00:37:39.900
interaction.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.190
And that's our A. Everything's
going to follow from that.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.660
Before I write some of the other
results, one thing to

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:50.670
notice is, it has N in it.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:54.990
In other words, there's a free
energy per molecule.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:38:01.430
The total free energy is just
something times N. And that's

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.800
because all the molecules
in this model are

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.290
independently behaving.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:11.390
So whatever their average free
energy is, that's going to add

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.940
up and give us the total.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.770
They're all acting
independently.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:18.410
And in fact, we could have
gotten this directly from

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:24.380
minus kT log little
q configurational.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:28.250
And if we look at energy,
regular energy, u,

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:35.040
configurational, it's minus
d log capital Q

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.630
with respect to beta.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:44.700
V and N. And I'll just
write the result.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:54.720
It's N times three E int e to
the minus beta E int over one

00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:00.890
plus three e to the
minus beta E int.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:06.090
And once again, the feature I
want to point out is that

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:09.380
there's a factor of N here.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:13.930
Again, there's an energy
per molecule.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:20.730
And so if we want, we can also
just write the average E,

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:25.740
little E, configurational.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:30.090
It's just u configurational over
N. It's the same as this

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:35.890
without the factor of N. Not
only that, again, we could get

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:40.530
this directly from
the molecular

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.750
partition function up there.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.220
From little q configurational.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.860
We'd have the same result.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.260
Exactly as it should be.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:55.610
So if we wrote E as we've seen
in the past, it's just the sum

00:39:55.610 --> 00:40:03.680
over that energy times the
probability for each state.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:09.010
And that's just the sum of
Ei, e to the minus beta

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:13.620
Ei over little q.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:19.050
And if you put in the terms,
you immediately get this.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:22.400
Here's our little q, and this
has the interaction energy

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:29.820
brought out, multiplied here.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.000
So the point is, in a case like
this, where you have a

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.170
bunch of independently behaving
particles, the totals

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:41.030
for these, for quantities like
energy, are simply for the

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.530
system energy, it's just the
average particle energy times

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.420
the number of particles.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.460
The number of molecules.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.000
And remember, before, I spoke
a little bit about the fact

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.460
that, well, if you look at one
individual molecule and

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.330
another and another, the
energy will fluctuate.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.540
It'll vary considerably.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.160
Of course, this is a simple
case with only

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.740
two possible energies.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.910
But in a case where there may
be many more possible

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.110
energies, the molecular
energies

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.440
may vary quite widely.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.400
Still, there will be a
well-defined average.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.940
And then the system energy
would simply be the total

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.430
number of molecules
times that.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.340
Where they're all independent.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.760
Where all the energies are
independent of each other.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.390
And, of course, the system
energy fluctuates a great deal

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:30.660
less than the individual
molecule energies.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:36.780
OK, so that's our energy term.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.240
And I think I won't write
out the results.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.750
They're in your notes
for entropy.

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:45.270
For chemical potential.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:46.010
They're all there.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.260
And again, the same
point would hold.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:53.900
They all scale with N. But I
want to talk a little bit

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.840
about the heat capacity.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.630
The expression for it
isn't so simple.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:04.980
So let me just right
Cv configurational.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:12.770
It's du configurational / dT,
at constant V and N. And

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.200
again, the details are worked
out in the notes.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.740
So I won't write out the
whole derivation of it.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.460
And even writing out the
results, I'm almost

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.130
reluctant to do it.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.700
But I'll put it up.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:32.470
Three E int over k T squared,
because there are some things

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:33.750
I want to point out about it.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:45.400
N, and then one plus three e to
the minus beta E int minus

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:52.630
E int e to the minus
beta E int.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:43:02.610
Minus e to the minus beta, I
have to get rid of this.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:14.380
Minus e to the minus beta E int
times negative three E int

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:19.370
e to the minus beta E int.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:30.380
All over one plus three e to
the minus beta E int, that

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.160
whole thing squared.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.180
And this is just, of course, the
kind of messy results that

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.160
comes from taking this
derivative with respect to

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.660
temperature and doing the chain
rule to get it with

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.400
respect to beta and so forth.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.490
So it looks like a little bit of
an intractable, or at least

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.380
a little bit of a complicated,
function.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.890
And the detailed functional
form is complicated.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:56.180
But what I want to emphasize is
that it has simple limits

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.780
that are very easy to understand
physically.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:43:59.550
And that are important to

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.800
understand for lots of systems.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:09.930
So I just want to look at the
limits of the heat capacity at

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.540
low and high temperature.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:15.980
And this is something that
recurs in statistical

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.760
mechanics, in an enormous number
of systems where you

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.570
have simplified limits.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:21.500
And they're really important.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.390
Because what's going
to matter is this.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:30.690
Maybe I shouldn't have covered
up those configurations.

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:35.490
So there's a big difference in
what happens when kT is much

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.490
bigger than this energy.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:40.490
Where you know that under those
conditions - let's say

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:43.380
it's hot, and this is a small
energy difference.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.530
Then the probabilities are
essentially equal.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.300
That the molecules are
in this state or in

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.000
any of these states.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.850
Because the energy is
so tiny compared

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:51.720
to the thermal energy.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.070
The molecules are continually
being kicked around between

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:56.740
all the states, among
all those states.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.070
So the high temperature limit,
physically, is one that's

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:01.400
simple to understand.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.510
Where now you're really just
going to revert to the cases

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.980
that we've treated before, where
all the energies are

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.770
effectively the same.

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:11.860
Because compared to
kT, they are.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.350
And in the low temperature
limit, now go to

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:15.200
the opposite limit.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.540
Let's say kT is much,
much, smaller than

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.380
the interaction energy.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:22.150
So that now this term
is really small.

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:24.280
Because this is much
bigger than this.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.710
So, what it means physically
is all the molecules are in

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:28.580
the ground state.

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.380
The probability of this
is basically one.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:33.070
The probability of being in any
of these states is zero.

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.700
And that's also a
simple result.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.940
And there are lots and lots of
cases where one of those

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.030
limits really obtains.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:44.600
If you look at molecules moving
around in the gas phase

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.110
or in a liquid.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.530
And you say, well, OK,
let's think about

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.290
their rotational motion.

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.800
Rotational energies are small.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.700
At room temperature, kT's
much bigger than them.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.220
You immediately go to the
high temperature limit.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.340
Now let's go to a small molecule
and look at the

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.990
vibrational energy.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:03.750
In most cases, the vibrational
frequency is pretty, molecules

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:05.860
are pretty stiff.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:07.860
And in many cases you can just
say, look, forget it.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.700
All the molecules are
in the ground state.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.760
And again, in the opposite,
but also simple

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.430
limit ends up holding.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:17.340
Or molecular electronic
states, right?

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.970
If you've got benzene or
hydrogen atoms in, say, at

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.470
room temperature, how many
hydrogen atoms thermally are

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:26.920
going to be up in the n equals
two state, the 2p

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.080
state or the 2s state?

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.120
Forget it.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.530
There's not nearly enough
thermal energy to do that.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:35.710
So these simpler limiting cases
play a huge role in

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.810
simplifying statistical
mechanics and the calculations

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:39.550
from them generally.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:42.400
OK, so let's just see
what happens.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:54.660
So, this we want, so this
we can move down.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:47:06.330
So our limiting cases, when T
goes to zero, not going to

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.040
work out what happens to
all the betas, beta

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.250
gets big in that case.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:18.130
But the result is that Cv
configurational goes to zero.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:21.680
That's the limit where, like
I've described, here is E

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.810
interaction, or E int.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:29.050
Here is zero.

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:33.000
And your kT is barely
above zero.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.160
So when all the molecules are
here, none of them has enough

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.650
thermal energy to be up here.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:42.430
So why should the heat
capacity be zero?

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:45.340
The heat capacity is du/dT.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.750
It's zero because, here's kT.

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:51.720
Let's say I increment
kT up a little bit.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:55.190
I just heat the system
a tiny, tiny bit.

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:58.930
An infinitesimal amount, to
look at the derivative.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.900
Once I do this, how many
molecules are in this

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.090
higher level now?

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.280
Still zero, right?

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.230
There's still not nearly enough
thermal energy to have

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.060
any molecules up here.

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.920
So what, was the derivative of
the energy with respect to the

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.610
temperature?

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:14.100
I changed the temperature.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.610
The energy didn't
change a bit.

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:22.470
And that means the heat
capacity is zero.

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:27.420
Now let's look at
the other limit.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.160
High temperature limit.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.680
Really, it doesn't need
to be infinity.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.870
It's really just T greater than,
much bigger than, kT is

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:36.810
much bigger than
E interaction.

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:39.425
And in this case, kT
is much less than

00:48:39.425 --> 00:48:41.170
the interaction energy.

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:44.180
So it doesn't need to be
nearly that extreme.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:51.230
Well, what you find out is the
heat capacity is zero.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:52.910
Now, it's zero.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:49:02.900
Because we're in the
following limit.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:09.830
Now kT is way up here.

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:15.490
Compared to kT, E interaction
is way down here.

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:16.870
So, what happens?

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:21.660
It means that this is so hot,
that term, The e to the minus

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:26.540
E int over kT, forget
it, it's one.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.960
And so the probability, in
other words, that the

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.440
molecules are in this
state or this state

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:31.710
are essentially equal.

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.280
So now let's say I raise
the temperature

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.960
a little bit higher.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.550
What happens to those
probabilities?

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:38.140
What changes?

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:38.360
Right.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.900
Nothing changes.

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.760
So what happened to the energy
when I raised the temperature?

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.920
Of course, nothing
happened to it.

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.980
Which means the heat
capacity is zero.

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:52.430
Now, the first limit that
I described, this

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:56.080
one is almost universal.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.640
For any system where you have
quantized level, you can

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.180
always eventually get to a low
enough temperature that you're

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.130
in the first limit.

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:07.680
Where the kT is lower than,
by far, than the

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.030
first excited level.

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.600
Everything's in the
ground state.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.440
And so you reach this limit.

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.650
This one, it's only cases
where you have a

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:20.240
finite number of levels.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.980
Then you have the same high
temperature limit to it.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:27.110
In other words, the reason this
result happens is because

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.350
there aren't a bunch of other
levels up here that eventually

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:33.100
get to be comparable to kT.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.830
And not all kinds of systems
or degrees of

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:37.340
freedom are like that.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:41.120
This one is, because there's a
finite number, four in this

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.170
case, of configurations.

00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:48.720
So there's just nothing
above there.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.840
There's another really important
kind of degree of

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.540
freedom like that.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.030
And that's spin.

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:55.350
Think of proton spins.

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:58.060
It's plus 1/2 or it's minus
1/2, and that's it.

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.190
You can't put any more
spin energy into it.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.790
Just like you can't put any more
configurational energy

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:07.510
into the system than to
be in this state.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:08.740
That's it.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:13.900
So in other words, the maximum
possible energy is finite.

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.060
Of course, lots of other
degrees of freedom are

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.280
different from that.

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.450
If you think a molecule's
rotating, they could always

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:21.190
spin faster.

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.760
Vibrating, they can
always vibrate

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.170
harder, translate faster.

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:31.420
Those degrees of freedom
won't have this limit.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.010
They also will have a simple
high temperature limit, but

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:36.550
not zero, because, of course,
if there are always more

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:39.720
levels, and I keep increasing
kT, then I'll have thermal

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.290
energy to go into those higher
and higher levels.

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.380
It'll still go up.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:48.280
But for systems with a finite
number of possible levels, and

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.700
a finite amount of total energy,
for degrees of freedom

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:55.400
like that, once I get to a
temperature higher than any of

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.210
that stuff, then forget it.

00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:59.160
You can't change the energy
anymore thermally.

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.040
So your heat capacity is zero.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.030
You can change the temperature
and nothing further happens.

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:06.840
OK, next time we'll see what
happens when you do have

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:10.280
continuing basically unbounded
possible energies.
