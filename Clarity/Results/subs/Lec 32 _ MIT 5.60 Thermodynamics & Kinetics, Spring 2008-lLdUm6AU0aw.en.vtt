00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:21.860
PROFESSOR: So, any
questions from last time?

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.090
We started doing
reaction mechanisms.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.430
We did first order
parallel reactions.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.280
So one of the things
that we'll be stressing

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.630
is that the mechanisms
that we write down

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.560
are ways to try to understand
a complicated chemical process.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:53.510
And you take data, you can
find intermediates sometimes.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.740
And you get rate
laws from the data.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.220
You infer rate laws.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.470
And from these rate
laws, you think up

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.890
of a reaction mechanism and you
make sure that what you measure

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.460
is consistent with
your mechanism

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.051
that you make up to explain the
complicated chemical process.

00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:16.800
And one really important
thing to remember

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.860
is that when you come
up with a mechanism

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.800
and you've got a bunch of data
that supports it, it's great.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.270
But it doesn't mean that
you've solve the problem.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.400
It doesn't mean
that you've proven

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.280
that the way that the
chemistry proceeds

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.780
is really the way it proceeds.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.822
Because there's
always the possibility

00:01:40.822 --> 00:01:42.780
that there's an intermediate
somewhere in there

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.930
that you haven't
been able to measure.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.280
And a lot of people
got tripped up

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.500
over the course of
the last century,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.700
of making up mechanisms, getting
a lot of data that supports

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.760
the mechanism and missing
something really important.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.350
So it's a common
mistake, that people

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.660
think they've proven
a particular chemical

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.880
mechanism just because they
have data that supports it.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.450
It's up to a certain point
that you know what you have.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.330
And we'll see examples
of that today, probably.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.660
And then certainly
next time when

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.000
we start making approximations
in our kinetics.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.990
And see where things
can really go wrong

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.600
if you don't have enough data.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.330
If you don't try
to fish out really,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.680
really, tiny intermediates
somewhere along the way.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.510
So last time we did then
parallel first order reactions.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.980
And today we're going
to march through and do

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.960
parallel first and second order.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.180
So one is first order, the
other one is second order.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.260
Things are going to
get more complicated.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.010
And what you're going
to get is a flavor

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.950
of how to solve the problems.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.319
Setting up the problems.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.860
We're not going to do a lot of
the algebra here on the board,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.870
because otherwise we
would spend the next three

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.080
weeks doing algebra.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.095
And that would be no fun at all.

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:07.470
That doesn't mean
that you're not

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.360
going to be doing any
algebra on the homework.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.520
Because part of it is
figuring how to do it.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.090
So, we have a reaction
where A goes to B plus C.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.480
And the first thing we did
was, the first mechanism

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.640
we wrote was a parallel
mechanism where

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.240
we had A goes B and A goes
to C. That's the mechanism.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.810
And one other way to write
it is A goes to B or C,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.810
in a way that is more,
sort of describes

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.830
the branching
process, that when we

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.810
talk about a branching ratio,
the ratio of amount of B to C,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.020
this looks like the branching
out of two different paths.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.520
And this time we're going to
do where this is first order

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.620
and this is second order.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.220
With the rate k1 and a rate k2.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.150
And the way that you
do all these problems,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.284
you have to be very
systematic about it.

00:04:18.284 --> 00:04:19.700
The first thing
you do is you have

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.240
to write down all
your rate laws.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.470
And make sure that you
include everything.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.830
So you start by writing the rate
law for the destruction of A.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.260
And then the rate law for the
appearance of B and for C.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.940
So for a, we have dA/dt.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.090
And again, I'm dropping
the brackets around the A,

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.030
because I don't want to carry
around all these extra symbols.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.990
So we destroy A by making B. So
that's going to be first order.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.721
And then we also
destroy A by making C,

00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:50.720
and that's second order.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.420
So we have two paths out
of A. To get rid of A.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.660
Then we write down the
appearance of B, dB/dt.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.710
It's only through one
path, first order in A,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.430
and then the appearance
of C, only one path

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.305
which is second order.

00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:18.180
And these are all our
differential equations.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.900
And now the trick is, how do you
solve these three differential

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:32.300
equations in a way that you
get meaningful information out.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.490
Well, the first
thing to do is to,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.532
so these two here depend on
A. So the appearance of B

00:05:41.532 --> 00:05:43.490
depends on A, the appearance
of C depends on A.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.490
But this one here only
depends on A by itself.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.904
So this is the first one
you're going to start out with.

00:05:47.904 --> 00:05:49.320
Because you can
put all of the A's

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.530
on one side and all the time on
the other side and integrate.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.340
So then you solve, and
you can rewrite this

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:10.740
as minus dA/dt is equal to
k1 times A times one plus k2

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.630
over k1 times A. And then you
put all the A's on one side,

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.950
all the t's on the other side.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:30.580
And integrate from A0 to A minus
dA over A times one plus k2

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:39.430
over k1 times A. That is
equal to k1 from zero to t dt.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.485
And then you have to
solve this integral here.

00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:44.410
And there's a reason why
I factored out the A here.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.910
It's because this
is of the form you

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.810
can use to use the trick
of partial fractions, which

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.900
we mentioned this before.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:07:01.650
So you use partial
fractions to solve this.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.380
And I'm not going to
do it on the board.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.270
You turn the crank,
you basically

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.560
write one over A times
one plus k2 over k1 A

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.184
is equal to n1 of A plus
n2 over this part here,

00:07:13.184 --> 00:07:15.350
and you solve for n1 and
n2 and you plug it back in,

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.730
and you redo your
integral, et cetera.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.802
And you get your answer.

00:07:19.802 --> 00:07:21.510
Which I'm going to
write down because I'm

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:29.170
going to use it
later. k1 A0 over e

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:36.195
to the k1 times
t, k1 plus k2 A0.

00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:37.820
So one of the things
we immediately see

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.930
is even though this mechanism
isn't very complicated,

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.470
just two paths, one first order,
one second order, the solutions

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:53.080
start to get not so
simple pretty quickly.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.590
So it depends, there's an
exponential on the bottom here.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.700
Depends on the initial
concentrations and both rate

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.205
constants are in there.

00:08:02.205 --> 00:08:03.580
The first thing
you want to do is

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:09.900
you want to look
at limiting cases.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.080
Just like before.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.520
We did, and the
first limiting case

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.300
we're going to look at,
so interesting to look at

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.110
is this guy right
here. k1 and k2 A here.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:27.870
If one is bigger than the other,
then things will cancel out.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.620
And we can get some intuition.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.270
So the first limiting case
we're going to look at

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:43.961
is where k2 A0, this term right
here, is much smaller than k1.

00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:46.210
Now, we want to make sure
that in these limiting cases

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.160
that when I write something like
this, that the units actually

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.080
make sense.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.200
That I'm not
saying, three apples

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.000
are less than four oranges.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.870
So k1, it's first
order, so the units

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.950
are one over second. k2, it's
a second order rate constant,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:07.534
so the units are one over second
molar, times moles per liter.

00:09:07.534 --> 00:09:08.950
So the moles per
liters cancel out

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.920
and I have one over our second
is less than one over second,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.160
so things are great.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.320
It I'm making the right
kind of approximation here.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.110
What else is this
approximation saying?

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:23.650
This is saying that the
rate into B, so this one is

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.670
the faster one. k1, the rate
into B, is the rate into,

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:32.580
is k1, is faster than k2 times
A, which is basically the rate

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:41.055
into C. So this is saying that
the rate into B, to form B,

00:09:41.055 --> 00:09:53.250
is faster than into C. So
we can write down a sketch.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.970
We can sketch what we expect
this approximation to be, then.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:04.370
And we know it's going to
look something like this.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:10.290
We know that A is going to
come down, exponentially.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.938
Without any structure to it.

00:10:11.938 --> 00:10:13.646
It's going to go either
into B or into C,

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:15.840
in some branching fractions.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.430
And we know that the rate
into B is faster than into C,

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.440
so B is going to
come up like this.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.510
And C is going to
come up, but slower.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:34.660
And there's going to be a
ratio between these two guys.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.400
So we know the slope here
is going to be slower

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.140
then the slope for B. And
we can check that out,

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.980
within our approximation.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:47.511
We can write, at t
equals zero, find out

00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:48.760
what these initial slopes are.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.780
For the creation of
B and C. So dB/dt

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:58.150
is the slope of the creation
of B at the beginning.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.930
At t equals zero.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.740
And that's just the
rate law. dB/dt at t

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:11.830
equals zero is k1 A0.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:21.320
And dC/dt, the initial slope, t
equals zero, is k1 A0 squared.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:28.430
Or k2 A0 squared, rather.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:36.890
So I'm going to write it as
k2 A0 squared, like this.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.130
We said k1 is much
bigger than k2 times A0.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.870
There's the same A0 here.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.730
So we see, just by
writing this down,

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.904
that our intuition that
because the rate into B

00:11:48.904 --> 00:11:51.320
is much faster than into A,
that it should look like this.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.700
Well it's borne out just
like this very simple sort

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.640
of looking at the initial
rate where the slope here

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.220
is much smaller
than the slope here.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:10.240
And then we can take the
approximation in here.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.330
And see what it implies.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:18.100
So let me do that here, let me
just use my green chalk here.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.520
So k2 A0 is much less than k1.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.760
So this is going to go away.
k2 A0 is much less than k1.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.260
Well, this is
building up from zero.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.530
So this is always
bigger than one here.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.171
So I can get rid
of this as well.

00:12:33.171 --> 00:12:34.670
Because there's the
k1 sitting here.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:39.100
And k1 is much
bigger than k2 A0.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:44.280
Once I got rid of all these two
guys, then the k1's cancel out.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.980
And this is looking very nice.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:50.110
Because now I can take that e
to the k1 t and put it upstairs.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:56.380
A is equal to approximately
A0 e to the minus k1 times

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.320
time in this approximation.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.870
It looks like it's
first order coming down,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.670
with a rate constant k1.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.250
It looks like basically
the branching into C

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.874
is nonexistent as far as, at
least in this approximation,

00:13:13.874 --> 00:13:14.790
as far A is concerned.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.970
It's going to look
like this thing here.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.650
It's going to look
like first order

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.120
A goes to B with
rate constant k1.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.330
So if you didn't
know, if you didn't

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.520
know that there was
another substance, C,

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.290
that was being formed along the
way, if you didn't measure it,

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.990
if you didn't do the analytical
chemistry and sort of fish it

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:41.870
out, and you just looked at the
two major components, A and B,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:45.130
in this case here, you'd
measure a rate out of A,

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.110
it would look like
it's first order.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.380
It's great.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.220
Got my mechanism.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.150
A goes to B, period.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.195
And you would know there
was a minor component that

00:13:57.195 --> 00:14:02.050
was being formed
at the same time.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:15.560
OK, let's do another
approximation.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:24.917
Let's do the other case, where
k2 A0 is much bigger than k1.

00:14:24.917 --> 00:14:26.500
And, in this case
here, you have to be

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.583
a little bit more careful.

00:14:27.583 --> 00:14:30.780
You have to add
that you're going

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.300
to look at this at early times.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.240
And we're going to see why
early times is important here.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.610
In just five minutes.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.180
And early times, and how
you define early times.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.000
What does it mean for things to
be close to time equals zero?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.250
Well, we have to have
a reference time scale.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.690
The reactions, I'm
going at a certain rate.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.150
And one second may be very slow.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.120
Or it may be very fast.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.640
Depending on the
rate of the reaction.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:03.220
So k1 here defines the
time scale of the problem.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.640
It's one over second,
unit of one over second.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.250
And early times means that
the times that I'm looking at

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:15.620
compare to this rate,
it's very small.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.960
So k1 t is less than one.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.520
That means that the time,
during the time period that I'm

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.680
looking at, hardly anything has
happened to the branching of A

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.360
to B. That that's what
I mean by early time.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.910
So B is hardly being built
up yet. k1 is our reference

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.590
time. k1 is units
of one over second.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.480
This has units of seconds.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.025
So it's all working out fine.

00:15:45.025 --> 00:15:47.650
In other words, I would have no
idea how to define early times.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.590
I could say, it's in
a year, it could be,

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.320
if you're looking
at plutonium decay,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.850
it's a 100,000 year half-life.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.460
A year would be an early time.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.760
So it would be really fast,
compared to the process.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.075
But if you're looking
at a reaction that

00:16:01.075 --> 00:16:04.450
takes a few nanoseconds than a
year would be very, very long.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.430
So you really need
your reference time

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:11.030
somewhere in there.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.910
So this approximation means
that essentially, no B

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.150
is being created.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.400
While we're looking
at the process.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.800
And so we might then
very well expect

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.165
that if we look at A and
C, that the answer is going

00:16:26.165 --> 00:16:29.110
to be that we're going to see
something that's second order.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:35.255
So we expect that the form
of A, the way to write it

00:16:35.255 --> 00:16:39.140
is going to be one over
A equals k1 t plus A0.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.950
So let's go ahead and
take our complete solution

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.620
and write it in the way that we
might expect the answer to be.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.500
In terms of one over
A rather than A here.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:56.760
So let's just invert it. e to
the k1 times time, k1 plus k2

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:07.900
A0, minus k2 A0 over k1 A0.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.190
This should be a
minus sign here.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.157
There should be a
minus sign here.

00:17:14.157 --> 00:17:15.740
It didn't matter for
our approximation

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.750
because we got rid
of it anyway, but it

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:24.120
would be a proper
sign here is minus.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.390
And so now we need to
make our approximation

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.530
and figure out what this here.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.400
So if we take the approximation
that k1 t is small, less

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.530
than one, then what that
should trigger in your mind

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.770
if that if you have e to
the something that small

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.061
you should use a Taylor series.

00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:42.990
And expand this into
a Taylor series.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.880
So we're going to see
this multiple times.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:51.650
So we take e to the k1 t
and expand it out as one

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:55.750
plus k1 t plus et cetera.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.850
We're going to keep the
first order terms in there.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:05.430
So we're going to plug this
approximation into here.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.600
That's this approximation there.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.680
And then we're going
to expand it out.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:21.510
So plug it in here, and, keeping
it to first order in time,

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.340
and multiplying it
out, and I'm not

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.940
going to do the
intermediate steps,

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.990
I'm just going to give
you the stuff after doing

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.870
the multiplications,
we get k1 t squared.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:37.130
So that's basically k1
times one plus k1 t,

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:45.600
and then you have
plus k1 k2 A0 times t.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.350
That's this term here. k1
k2 A0 times t times that.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.190
And the k2 A0 times
one gets subtracted out

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.232
from this minus k2 A0 here.

00:18:56.232 --> 00:18:57.440
So that's all we have on top.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.304
And then there are terms
of higher order in time.

00:19:00.304 --> 00:19:01.970
But we're not going
to worry about this.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.670
We're going to stick
to first order in time.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.420
Divided by k1 A0.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.990
And now you do
your cancellations.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.530
We have our
approximation at k1 times

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.940
time is much less than one.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.600
So here we have k1
times k1 times time.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.980
So this term here means it's
much less than this term

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.540
here, because of
our approximations.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.960
So we can get rid
of this term here.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.920
Get rid of that.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.690
There's no reason for us to
get rid of this one here.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:40.490
Because we've got k2 A0 there,
which is much larger than k1.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:45.520
And so when you expand this out,
all the k1's cancel out here.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.660
So so k1 cancels out that
k1, we have one plus one.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.340
So this is basically
one over A0.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.480
And then we have plus
k2 A0 time over A0,

00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:07.060
so this ends up being equal to
one over A0 plus k2 times time.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.310
Exactly what we expected.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.990
That if you put in the right
approximation in the math,

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.270
it behaves as your
intuition would tell you.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.140
Which is that the branching
into B nonexistent.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.500
And that you're looking
at everything going to C.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.280
It looks second order
in C. But in this case

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.040
here, it's only early times.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.740
So if you keep
going, what happens?

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.990
If you keep going in
time, beyond the time

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:40.360
scale of this first
order rate constant,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.470
and you wait long enough,
then the amount of A

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.800
keeps decreasing.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.800
Keeps getting
smaller and smaller.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.580
So if you start the clock
again, a little bit later,

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.020
where A is much
smaller, then k2 times

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.030
the amount of A you
have there, is no longer

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.230
going to be much
greater than k1.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:09.980
At some point along
the way, k2 times A

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.360
is going to be
much less than k1.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.377
So at some point
along the way, it's

00:21:15.377 --> 00:21:17.210
not going to be this
approximation any more.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.400
It's going to be the
previous one that we did.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.010
The one up there.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.510
So at early times we
start with something

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:29.420
that may look second order for
A. Time goes on, time goes on,

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.290
time goes on, A gets depleted.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.170
A gets depleted, and
the rate k2 times

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.510
A, which is sitting right
here, this part here

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.850
becomes smaller and smaller.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.210
And pretty soon this part wins.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.240
And it becomes first order.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.370
So what you'd
expect to see, then,

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:59.950
is if you were to plot
as a function of A,

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.860
you expect to see something
that starts out as first order

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.130
and then as A gets depleted,
switches over to second order.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.220
Something that's
second order here.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.550
And first order.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:17.720
This is the concentration of
A. So if you were to plot it,

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.260
here you're plotting
the concentration of A.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:26.230
If you were to plot the log,
of the concentration of A,

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.500
at long times you'd expect
it to be first order.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.960
So something linear.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.030
But at early times you'd
expect it to be second order.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.320
So you'd expect to see
something that's nonlinear,

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.060
then switching to
something linear.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:47.110
And if you were to
plot it as one over A,

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.610
then you'd expect to start off
with something that's linear,

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:53.650
at second order, early times.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.130
But instead of keeping,
being second order,

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:04.220
as you deplete the amount
of A, the branching into B

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.680
becomes important.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.710
And you become second order.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:14.380
So this is second
order at the beginning.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:23.150
And this becomes first order.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:26.040
So, any questions here?

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.600
The importance of
doing this problem

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.390
here was to lay out
basically a systematic way

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.800
of looking at the problem.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:39.080
You lay out your rate equations.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.030
Like this.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:45.230
You solve what you can, in
this case you solve for A.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.360
And it's complicated.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.220
So you want to learn
something about what

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.630
the data might look like.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:51.980
And you look at limiting cases.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.530
Two obvious limiting cases.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.370
One rate is faster
than the other.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.110
You pick the first one
first, then go through it.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.860
And then use your intuition.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.830
Every point along the
way, your intuition

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.990
can tell you what you
expect the result to be.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.690
So in this case
here, our intuition

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.160
told us that if we
took the rate into B

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.326
to be much faster
than that into C,

00:24:15.326 --> 00:24:16.700
than we expected
to see something

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.430
that was largely first order.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.870
And when you we
the approximation

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.290
in our exact solution,
in fact it does

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.330
look like it's first order.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.600
So always use your intuition.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.760
Because the math is going
to get pretty hairy.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.110
The algebra might
make it complicated.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.090
And it's really easy
to make a plus sign

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.980
into a minus sign
somewhere along the way.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.810
Just like I did here.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.820
So if I hadn't fixed
my mistake here,

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.219
and I had gone and put
in my Taylor series here,

00:24:45.219 --> 00:24:46.510
I would have gotten in trouble.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.468
Because this minus sign
would have been a plus.

00:24:48.468 --> 00:24:50.760
And these k2 A0's would
not have canceled out.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.330
And I wouldn't have gotten
the right result, which

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:59.230
my intuition had told me should
be a second order process.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.920
And so if you have a problem,
let's say you're on an exam

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.780
and you're doing algebra,
you're trying to,

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.160
and you end up
with a result that

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.624
doesn't match what your
intuition tells you,

00:25:08.624 --> 00:25:10.040
and you don't have
time to fix it.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.700
Tell us.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.517
You know, I know this
is wrong because I

00:25:12.517 --> 00:25:14.100
know it's supposed
to be second order.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.880
But I don't know
where I went wrong.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.100
And that's really important.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.320
Just tell us.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:27.324
That means that you're thinking.

00:25:27.324 --> 00:25:28.990
Let's get a little
bit more complicated.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:35.670
Any questions?

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:38.790
Consecutive series reactions.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.140
These were parallel
reactions and now.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.750
Basically what
we're doing here is

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:47.740
we're building up a toolkit
of simple mechanisms.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.110
And then we'll be able to
put these mechanisms together

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:57.980
to make something
more complicated.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:04.840
So the next kind of mechanism,
series mechanism, series

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.280
reactions, so we
have our reaction.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.149
Which is A goes to
C. And the mechanism

00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:15.690
that's been thought
for this reaction

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.170
is that there's an intermediate.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.090
That first you have A goes to
B, some intermediate, which gets

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:27.480
used up to form the final
product, C, with a rate, k2,

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.520
here.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.790
And we can either write
the mechanism in two steps.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:41.180
Or we can write it as A goes
to B goes to C, like this.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:45.067
And see both ways of writing it.

00:26:45.067 --> 00:26:46.150
And we want to solve this.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.691
And we want to look
at special cases,

00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:50.390
and we just want to
understand the implications

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:51.230
of this mechanism.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.313
So the first thing to do,
just like we did before,

00:26:53.313 --> 00:26:57.970
is to write all the rate laws.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.410
Before we got going
solving anything.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.080
So we start with A, minus dA/dt.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.510
There's only one way
that gets used up.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:11.270
Through the formation of B
in a first order process.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:12.130
Easy.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.060
This is easy to solve.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:17.970
We know the answer is going
to be exponential in it.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:23.240
For B, dB/dt is
equal to, well it

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.680
can be formed through
my first order in A,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.480
so that's k1 times
A. But it also

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.000
could get destroyed
by forming C.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.360
So we've got to get
all the paths out

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.120
of A, here on the right
side of this equation.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.290
So it can be destroyed
in a process, which

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.795
is first order in
B. So we're going

00:27:42.795 --> 00:27:49.537
to take both k1 and k2 to
be first order initially.

00:27:49.537 --> 00:27:51.870
Then we'll make one of them
second order and things will

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.330
become very complicated and
we'll throw up our hands.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.350
But for now, let's not throw
up our hands quite yet.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.480
OK and for dC/dt,
there's only one way

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.810
it can be formed is first
order by destroying B.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.070
And we have a couple of
differential equations here.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:16.350
This differential equation
for C, depends on B here.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:21.150
The differential for
B depends on A here.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.650
So that means that things are
going to get a little bit more

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.935
complicated.

00:28:27.935 --> 00:28:30.060
The easy one to solve is
always the first one here.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.380
That's first order.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.140
So we just write
down the answer.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:38.800
A is equal to A0, e
to the minus k1 t.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.030
We know the answer to that one.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:46.790
Then we have to work
on B. So we want

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:51.010
to find out integrated rate laws
for every one of these chemical

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:59.950
species.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.990
And always there
are tricks involved.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.840
Partial fractions, whatever.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.480
So we write down
B now. dB/dt plus,

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.170
let me rearrange it a little
bit, plus k2 times B, putting

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.320
the minus k2 B on
the other side here.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.502
Is equal to k1
times A. But I'm not

00:29:16.502 --> 00:29:18.210
going to keep this A
there, because now I

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.410
know what A is in terms of time.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:28.790
And a constant. k1 times A0
e to the minus k1 times time.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.340
OK, that's my
differential equation

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:35.370
for B. Got to solve this thing.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.270
Well, the last time I did
differential equations

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.610
in college was a century ago.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.250
And I wasn't kidding.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.590
It really was last century.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.920
In fact, it was last millennium.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.234
That was a long time ago.

00:29:49.234 --> 00:29:50.150
So how do you do this?

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.940
Well, the trick here,
there's a trick.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:58.310
And the trick is to multiply the
whole thing, both sides, by e

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:01.470
to the k2 t.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.510
And you multiply this
side by e to the k2 t

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:06.520
and you multiply this
side by e to the k2 t,

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.620
to solve this equation.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.270
So once you do
that, then you have

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:22.326
e to the k2 t times dB/dt plus
k2 times B. This side here.

00:30:22.326 --> 00:30:30.200
And then you have is equal to
k1 times A0 e to the minus, e

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:39.380
to the k2 minus k1 times time.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.515
OK, so the reason
why this trick works

00:30:42.515 --> 00:30:47.270
is because this guy right
here can be nicely written

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:56.430
as d/dt of B times
e to the k2 t.

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.500
It's in nice simple form,
so when you integrate,

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.254
it'll be very easy to integrate.

00:31:01.254 --> 00:31:02.670
And then the other
side, you still

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:12.350
have k1 A0 e to the k2
minus k1 times the time.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.530
So now you integrate
both sides with respect

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:18.180
to time, The integral of
something d/dt with respect

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.690
to time, it's just going
to be itself right here.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.190
So it's very simple.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.540
So you integrate both sides
from zero to time, dt.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:31.430
Zero to t, dt on both sides.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:34.480
And on this side here,
you end up with B,

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:42.340
e to the k2 times time minus
B, e to the k2 times zero.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:47.440
Just taking the upper limit
minus the lower limit.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:53.840
And that's just equal to
B0, at time to equal zero.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.740
And so, and at
time to equal zero,

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.870
B0 is equal to zero because we
haven't made any intermediates.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:06.480
So this goes away.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.410
And then we have an equals sign.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:15.079
And on the other side, we
have k1 A0 over k2 minus k1,

00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:16.620
it's just the integral
of this thing,

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:21.580
here with a k2 minus k1
goes in the denominator. e

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:28.290
to the k2 minus k1
times time minus one.

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:33.150
So now you have your integral
form for the amount of B

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.820
that gets created at any time.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.980
And I want to keep
that on the board.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.540
Because I'm going
to use it later.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:52.250
k1 A0 over k1 minus k2 times
e to the minus k1 times

00:32:52.250 --> 00:33:01.810
time minus e to the
minus k2 times time.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:03.770
OK, we're two thirds
of the way through.

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:10.080
Now we've got to find C.
And for the last component,

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.290
you don't want to be
doing this kind of stuff.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.830
You don't want to waste your
time solving differential

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:20.082
equations, because
stoichiometry can help you out.

00:33:20.082 --> 00:33:22.040
At the end of the day,
you know that everything

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.340
that started out as A,
in terms of quantities,

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.240
is going to end up at C.
You know that if you end up

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.220
with a concentration
A0 at the beginning,

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.440
at the end of the process
the concentration of C,

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.210
at infinite time, is
also going to be A0.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:41.470
If you know that
there's a correlation,

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:46.130
there's a stoichiometry that
relates A and C together.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:53.200
And B. You have conservation
of mass here, basically.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.430
Conservation of atoms.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.610
That has to come into play

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:07.870
So, for C, we're just going to
do algebra instead of calculus.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.620
So let's write down
the stoichiometry here.

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:15.370
The amount of C at
any time is what

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.200
it's going to be at the end.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.600
Which is A0, very
end of the process.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.240
It's going to be A0.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.530
But before we get
to the end, there's

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.346
still stuff that's
left in A and B.

00:34:28.346 --> 00:34:30.220
And that's going to
decrease the amount of C.

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:35.660
So minus whatever's
still in A and B.

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.712
That's the stoichiometry.

00:34:37.712 --> 00:34:38.920
That's one way of writing it.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.711
You could also write
it in a different way.

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:47.450
Which is that the amount of
C is equal to the amount of A

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:50.240
that you have used up.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.270
A0 is what you started out with.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.350
A is what's left over.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.210
So this is the
amount of A used up.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.280
It's not all quite in C yet.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.510
Some of it is stuck in B.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:06.060
So it's the amount of A used
up, minus the amount that's

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.330
stuck in B. Those
two are the same.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:10.580
I hope.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.220
A0 minus A, yeah, that's right.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.940
Minus B, yeah, that's right.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.180
So this is used up.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:26.770
And then stuck in B.
That's the hard part.

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.080
Putting down the stoichiometry.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.710
Once you've done
the hard part, then

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.180
if you solve the other
two then it's easy.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:32.888
You just plug in.

00:35:32.888 --> 00:35:35.210
It's just algebra.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:37.910
And you get something
complicated.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:43.920
C is equal to complicated.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:49.110
It's in the notes, I'm not
going to write it down.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.680
So we've solved the
problem exactly.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.389
And now you're going
to do an experiment.

00:35:53.389 --> 00:35:54.930
And the experiment
you're going to do

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.100
is not going to follow
this whole thing, exactly.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.840
It's going to look
at limited cases.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.560
That's what you can do.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.020
And so the first
thing to look at

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.140
is to look at the initial times.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.840
The very beginning
of the process,

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.180
how are things appearing.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:33.240
And then we'll look
at the late times.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.940
So initial times.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:46.040
Near t equals zero.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:50.780
Well, every one of these things
has an exponential in it.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.470
And whenever we see exponentials
and we look at something

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:57.040
at the early times, times that
are faster than one over k1,

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.940
or faster than one over k2, it
tells us use a Taylor series.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.210
So use the approximation
e to the minus kt

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:14.510
is approximately equal to
one minus kt plus kt squared

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.110
over two plus et cetera.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:20.040
And keep as many terms as
you need in the Taylor series

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.640
to get something sensible.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.610
So if everything comes
out of zero at the end,

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:26.210
you know you haven't
kept enough terms in t.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.110
Things have canceled
out too much.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.010
And you want something
that is time dependent.

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.210
Because you've got a
change in time, right?

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:36.330
It's a very common mistake
to say only keep one here

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.680
and then everything
cancels out you get zero,

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.940
and you say, well, B is
equal to zero at all times.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.390
That's nonsensical.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.330
And I don't know a priori
how much time to keep.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:53.340
So let's go to second order.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:38:00.150
So if you plug this
Taylor series into A,

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.230
and get something
that's time dependent,

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.070
you only need to
go to first order.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:08.850
One minus k1 times
time plus et cetera.

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:14.000
Plug it into b, plug your
Taylor series into these two

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:22.450
guys here, get k1
A0 over k2 minus k1,

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.640
you only need it to
go to first order.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.720
The one's cancel out but
the times don't cancel out.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:33.160
Minus k1 plus k2, that is,
unless k1 and k2 are the same.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.130
So we're making
the approximation

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:38.930
that k1 is different than k2.

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.430
Times the time.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.780
And when we look at C,
this complicated thing

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.680
that I didn't write
down, if you were just

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.832
to stop at first order in
C, you get C equals zero.

00:38:50.832 --> 00:38:52.040
You know that can't be right.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.036
You know that C is going
to increase in time.

00:38:55.036 --> 00:38:56.660
It can't be equal to
zero at all times.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:00.950
So we have to go to
second order for C0.

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:08.560
And it's approximately equal to
A0 times k1 k2 over two times

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.459
the time squared.

00:39:11.459 --> 00:39:13.250
Let me rewrite this a
little bit closer in,

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.450
because I need some room here.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:20.540
So c is approximately
equal to A0 k1

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.807
is k2 over two
times time squared.

00:39:24.807 --> 00:39:26.390
OK, and then we can
start plotting out

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.931
what this is going
to look like then.

00:39:27.931 --> 00:39:30.960
So we have the concentrations
time on the axis here.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.305
Let's start with the
concentrating of A. A

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:38.200
is dropping down
linearly in time.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.850
It's dropping down
linearly in time here.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:46.590
B is increasing linearly
in time, at the beginning.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:51.190
So B is going up linearly
in time, like this.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:55.210
And C is increasing
quadratically in time.

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.120
So it's pretty flat,
coming up first.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:03.150
And then it starts to curve up.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.070
It's our first approximation.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:09.494
Then, we go to late
times. t equals infinity.

00:40:09.494 --> 00:40:11.660
So t equals infinity where
am I going to write this?

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:33.010
Have to move this up.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:35.620
Let's go, t goes to infinity.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.160
Well, here I know that
I'm allowed to go to zero.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.560
Or allowed to go to constant,
because infinity is forever.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:46.180
So at t infinity, I know that
I'm going to use up all of A.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.620
So I know that A is
going to be equal to 0.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.820
I know I'm going
to use up all of B.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.670
So I know B is
going to go to zero.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.920
Somehow.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.950
And I know that C is
going to go to A0.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:07.840
So C is going to go
to A0 at infinity.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:17.390
So now on my graph here,
I know that at infinity, A

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:20.850
is going to go down to
zero like this, somehow.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.960
Probably exponentially, because
it is exponential in time.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.710
So it's going to go
to zero exponentially.

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.630
B is going to go down
to zero exponentially.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.070
There are the
exponentials right here.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.580
So B is going to go down
to zero exponentially.

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.500
Something like this.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.160
And C is going to
saturate to A0.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.770
Exponentially rise up to A0.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.510
So this was A0 right here.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.730
It's going to go like this.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:47.160
So then I connect the dots.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.810
And I know that C is going
to start quadratically.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:53.550
And then it's going to rise
up an exponent like this.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.220
I know that B is going
to start off linearly,

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.470
and then it has to go to zero.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:03.030
So it has to go through
some sort of maximum.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:08.120
And A is going to go
down exponentially,

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.640
exponentially like this.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.550
So the interesting
part of this diagram

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:13.870
is that B goes to a maximum.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:20.680
There is some point,
there's some time,

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.870
that we can call t sub B
max, where B is a maxima.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.570
And that's an interesting point.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.250
That's something that we can
try to figure out experimentally

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.710
what it is.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:33.990
And we could get
some parameters,

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:36.810
we could maybe extract
some information.

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:42.470
There's a maximum B,
concentration of B,

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:45.190
that gets formed.

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.860
And how do you solve that?

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:52.590
You set dB/dt equal to zero.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:55.510
So you have your equation
for B right here.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:58.820
You set it equal to
zero. and you solve.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.290
You get your maximum time.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.390
It's made up of rate constant.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.190
You get your maximum
concentration,

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:07.120
which is also made
up of rate constants.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.791
And you can get rate
constants out of this.

00:43:09.791 --> 00:43:10.290
Question.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:16.555
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:16.555 --> 00:43:17.180
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:22.705
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:22.705 --> 00:43:24.080
PROFESSOR: That
is a coincidence.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:31.380
That is my poor sketching.

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:37.870
It should probably be somewhere
like, in the middle here.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:41.359
Actually, it completely
depends on the rates.

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:42.900
And we're going to
see limiting cases

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.970
where this maximum
can occur here,

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:51.860
or it can occur
somewhere down here.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:57.610
So this is the complete case.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:04.772
So, limiting cases. the
important limiting cases.

00:44:04.772 --> 00:44:06.480
We've made an
approximation along the way

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.688
that k1 is different than k2.

00:44:07.688 --> 00:44:10.950
So that has to be a case
that needs to be worked out.

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:17.690
And it's likely to be easier
than the full solution.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:22.300
So one of the limiting
cases is k1 is equal to k2

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:27.180
and I'll leave
that for homework.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:31.010
You can do that yourselves.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:34.255
It's good exercise.

00:44:34.255 --> 00:44:35.630
What about another
limiting case?

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.740
Well, you have two
other limiting cases.

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.140
One, you've got two rates.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:45.540
So, one is bigger
than the other.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.980
No information on
this board here.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:54.550
You start off with one case.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:45:03.050
So k1 greater than k2.
k1 greater than k2.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.840
What does it mean?
k1 greater than k2.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.360
It means that the
rate determining

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.320
step, or the limiting
step, in this reaction,

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:16.330
is the second step. k2 is
very slow compared to k1.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:21.850
And sometimes I like to think
of these things as pipes.

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:25.460
And connecting vessels.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:30.490
So let's say we have
the amount of liquid

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:32.530
in the top vessel is
the concentration of A.

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.870
The amount of liquid
in the middle vessel,

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:45.972
let me get my color scheme
to be consistent here.

00:45:45.972 --> 00:45:47.430
Then we have a
middle vessel, which

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:50.380
is the concentration of B,
and a final vessel, which

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.650
is the concentration
of C. And we start out

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:59.250
with some sort of
amount of A in here.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.940
Started with a lot of A,
and then these vessels

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.910
are connecting with pipes.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:07.150
So there's a very
thick, big pipe

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:11.050
that connects A and B together.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:16.430
The rate is fast,
going from A to B.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.780
And the rate going
from B to C is slow,

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:26.930
so there's a skinny pipe
connecting B and C together.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.080
Then I turn on the
system, I set time

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.680
to equal zero,
poof, what happens?

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.360
There's the big pipe
connecting A and B.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.050
The whole amount of a here gets
transferred to B, suddenly.

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.090
Then it gets stuck here.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:41.830
And then it dribbles
out from B to C.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:44.050
So what do we expect,
if we were to plot

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:49.100
our quantities as
a function of time.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.820
What we'd expect
then, then we're

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.470
going to make sure that
the math works out,

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:58.350
is that A is going to
decrease really fast.

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:02.050
It's going to go, poof.

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:08.770
First order in time
with a very fast rate.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:11.680
And all of this is going
to go straight into B.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.305
So we expect B to go linearly.

00:47:13.305 --> 00:47:14.930
Remember, at the
beginning it's linear.

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.040
Linear goes up.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.420
Almost all the way up to A0.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.400
Because it can't hardly get out.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.770
Reaches its maximum,
then it goes from B to C

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:28.590
through this
skinny, skinny pipe.

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:31.540
First order rate,
with a rate k2,

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:35.970
so we're exponentially going
down, slowly, slowly, slowly,

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.800
with a rate k2.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:44.280
And then C starts quadratically.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:48.370
And then very quickly,
once everything's into B,

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:49.880
A is forgotten.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.540
A doesn't matter any more.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.305
Basically what you're
looking at is a transfer of B

00:47:54.305 --> 00:47:56.810
into C through this little pipe.

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:59.100
And you know that's going
to be a first order of rate.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.040
First order of process,
B to C's first order

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.690
of process with rate k2.

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.830
So you expect, then, C to
go up in the first order

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:13.490
process to A0 with rate k2.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:18.450
There's the rate k2 here.

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:22.650
And the rate k1 here.

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:25.230
So when you turn the crank on
your approximation in the math,

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:31.050
what you'd better see
is that at the end,

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:32.890
B as a function of
time should look

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:36.400
like a first order
process with rate k2.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.730
C as a function of time
should look like a first order

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:41.220
process with rate
k2, going to A0.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.180
And you can write
the answer, you

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.320
should be able to
write the answer,

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.930
for C, it's going to
be C is approximately,

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.890
it's going to go to A0,
there's no other choice.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.852
Everything that was in A gets
transferred to B0, so at time

00:48:56.852 --> 00:48:58.560
is infinity it's going
to be A0, and it's

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:01.120
going to be a first order
process with rate k2.

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:06.100
One minus e to the
minus k2 times times.

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.830
I don't even have
to do the math.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.580
I know that's the answer.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:14.420
If you don't believe
me, then do the math.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.034
You should do it.

00:49:16.034 --> 00:49:16.950
But that's the answer.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:18.990
It has to be the answer.

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:24.950
And if you look at
B, the answer has

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:31.640
to be that it's approximately
looking like B is disappearing

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.760
with a rate constant that's
k2, e to the minus k2,

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.550
and the maximum here
is very close to A0.

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.400
So I'm going to be
putting A0 here.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.040
Close enough.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.270
So as long as I ignore the
very initial time where

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:50.580
A suddenly dumps into B, then
everything after that very

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:55.220
early time here is just
looking like B goes to C.

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.340
This is not zero, this is t.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.960
And A just disappears quickly.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:06.340
And we can write it as A is
equal to A0 e to the minus

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.530
k1 times the time.

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:12.960
That's an easy approximation.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.360
And you've just got to
make sure that this fits.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:22.320
So the other limiting
case, which I'm also

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.070
going to leave as a
homework, because it's

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:30.610
so straightforward, is to
have k2 greater than k1,

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:34.240
and you should make sure
that you can predict it.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:38.170
and that the math works out.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:39.660
OK, any questions?

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.420
Next time we'll do
reversible reactions.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:46.010
And some more approximations.
