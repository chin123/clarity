PROFESSOR NELSON: So last time
we just about finished up the

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.540
discussion of thermochemisty,
and we went through a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.600
description of calorimetry,
how we actually make

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.500
measurements of thermodynamic
a quantities.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.550
I should mention, which I didn't
last time, that you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.330
know a calorimeter, apart from
measuring heats of formation

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.650
also is used to measure
standard thermodynamic

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.400
quantities like heat
capacities.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.480
You know how much heat does it
take to raise the temperature

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.540
of something by a degree?

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.290
Well, you put the material
inside the calorimeter, and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.100
you have a heater and it's
connected up to current

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490
source, and you can accurately
measure how much heat you're

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.800
putting in, because you can
measure how much current is

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.980
going into it, and you
separately are measuring the

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.050
temperature of the material, so
it's a straightforward way

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.310
of measuring the heat
capacities, thermodynamic data

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.080
of this sort.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.590
So work on phase transitions,
just ordinary

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.670
properties of material.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.880
Chemical reactions, all the
thermochemistry involved is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.510
done using constant pressure or
constant volume calorimetry

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.530
in a pretty routine way.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.890
So we talked about how to use
the results of measurements

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.420
like that to calculate
reaction energetics,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.730
enthalpies of reaction.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.070
And I just want to end the unit
on thermochemistry with a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.420
real brief discussion of an
approximate way of formulating

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.110
heats of reaction, and that is
in terms of bond energies.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.920
Now you know you're probably
never going to sit down and do

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.360
a series of thermodynamic

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.840
calculations using bond energies.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.460
You could always look up heats
of formation of compounds and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.680
from those determine very
accurately heats of reaction,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.270
by looking at the heats of
formation of products and the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.320
heats of formation
of the reactants

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.720
and subtracting them.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.480
And since that data is available
for a really wide

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.980
range of materials, that's sort
of the simplest approach

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.570
and the most accurate one to
determine reaction energetics.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.990
On the other hand, if you just
want to think about molecules,

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.580
you know, you think
about bonds.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.140
You know if you say I've got
methane or ethane, I'm going

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.390
to use a fuel and burn it
and capture the energy.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.260
How much energy do
we have in there?

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.240
Well the way you want to be
thinking about that is all

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.380
right, I'm going to take the
starting material, the fuel,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.170
I'm going to break bonds, and
I'm going to form some final

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.870
product with new bonds.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.630
Roughly what kinds
of energetics

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.030
are we talking about?

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.610
In biological systems, it's
also super important.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.050
You know you think about
ordinary biochemical

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.520
energetics, what's used is fuel
in biology and what are

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.270
the products that are formed?

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.050
And again, it's just super
important to be able to think

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.100
sort of semi-quantitatively
in terms of bond energies,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.300
because you don't want to always
be going and looking up

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.510
everything in tables.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.850
If you need to do an extensive
series of calculations, it's

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.640
very useful to have
the tables.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.560
But if you just want to think
about how something is

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.610
working, you know biological
or system or an engine or

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.620
another application, it's very
useful to just be able to

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.880
think in terms of
bond energies.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.510
So let's just go over
bond energies.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.360
And you've seen this in 5.111
and 2, so I'm not going to

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.580
belabor it but they're just a
little bit of examples that I

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.170
want to go through, just so
it's fresh on your mind.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.790
So the idea, of course, is to be
able to have an idea of how

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.830
much energy is involved
in forming or

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.880
breaking a single bond.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.770
So, if we just do this by
example, we can take methane

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.840
so it's a real simple case
because we know it's just got

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.040
four identical carbon hydrogen
bonds, and we could say OK,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.370
let's just break them.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.080
So we'll start with methane
gas and go to one atom of

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.160
carbon in the gas phase,
plus four atoms of

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.010
hydrogen in the gas phase.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.550
The energetics in this case
aren't given by the usual

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.440
heats of formation.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.120
You'd just say, if I want to
know about methane, I can look

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.620
up its heat of formation from
the elements in their

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.020
standards states. but the
difference here is these

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.300
elements aren't in their
standard states.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.010
Carbon in its standard state
at room temperature and

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.140
pressure is graphite, a solid,
it's not carbon atoms in the

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.270
gas phase, and hydrogen in the
standard state is hydrogen

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.260
molecules H2, not individual
atoms.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.430
All right, so we'd like to
have this bond energy for

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.510
these things.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.400
So let's just to make a cycle
that will allow us to

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.550
determine this.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.200
So this'll be our first step in
that cycle, or one way of

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.720
getting there.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.750
And this delta H of reaction is
going to be by definition

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:18.250
four times our bond energy for
a carbon hydrogen bond.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.500
Now let's go to be elements that
are in their standards

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.370
states at room temperature
and pressure.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:34.150
So let's go to carbon
as graphite.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:42.320
And let's go to two molecules of
hydrogen gas, so this will

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:52.590
be step two and this
will be step three.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.420
And this will allow us to work
because now we're starting in

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.830
standard states, so
we can just use

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.420
regular heats of formation.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.510
And that's the key.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:08.140
So if we look at step one
delta H1 there as we've

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:16.800
defined it, four times
our bond energy.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:24.180
Two, this is just negative heat
of formation of methane,

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:33.390
which we can look up.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:43.690
And three, is similar.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.860
Essentially it's the heat of
formation of carbon in the gas

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.330
phase and hydrogen atoms in the
gas phase, commonly called

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.830
heats of atomization, but these
are also tabulated just

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.820
like heats of formation
of ordinary compounds.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.870
In fact, in the appendix
to your book that has

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.050
thermodynamic data, you can find
carbon gas phase atoms

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.960
including heat of formation,
and same with individual

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.800
hydrogen atom as opposed
to hydrogen

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.390
molecules in the gas phase.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.380
So those data are available.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:25.450
So we can write delta Hc from
atomization, and two times

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:31.800
delta H of H2.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.470
This is the way this is
tabulated and this is molar.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.460
And of course now we've
written a cycle.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.320
So we know that to get from here
to here is the same as to

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.490
go through these two steps.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.050
In other words delta H1 is the
sum of delta H2 and delta H3.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:07.240
And so this says that our four
times the carbon hydrogen bond

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:14.270
energy is just given by minus
the heat of formation of

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:25.280
methane plus the heat of
atomization of carbon, plus

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.080
the two times the heat
of atomization

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:35.280
for hydrogen molecules.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.500
And if we look up the numbers
that are tabulated, what we

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:50.090
discover is that our carbon
hydrogen bond energy is 416.2

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:57.470
kilojoules per mole.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.310
Very useful to have numbers like
that stored in your head.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.030
To have some basic idea of
just ordinary chemical

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.900
energetics in terms
of bond energies.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:14.265
Hydrogen bonds, you know roughly
20 kilojoules per

00:09:14.265 --> 00:09:15.650
mole, and so forth.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.570
Just having those kinds of
energetic enables you to think

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.040
in a qualitative way about
what's likely to happen in an

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.040
ordinary chemical or biochemical
situation.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.580
OK, so this is in a sense the
simplest case, because we've

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.910
talked about the dissociation of
a molecule that consists of

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.800
all identical bonds.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.710
But it's straightforward
to go from there to

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.490
additional bond energies.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.380
So from this we've got a value
for a sort of typical carbon

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.890
hydrogen bond, right.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.570
We can do the same thing now for
ethane, and that's got a

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.640
single carbon carbon bond, as
well as a bunch of carbon

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.900
hydrogen bonds, but now the we
know the carbon hydrogen bond

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.370
energy, we can use that number
plus the relevant heats of

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.480
formation to determine the
carbon carbon bond energy.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.900
And we can keep going and extend
this to essentially

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.360
tabulate bond energies for a
very large number of different

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.350
sorts of bonds.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:31.450
So just as an example, ethane,
so now we're going to have --

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.920
this I'll write it all out just
some we can keep proper

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.850
track of all the bonds that
we're going to be breaking.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:46.730
So C2H6 goes to two carbon
gas phase atoms, and

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:54.080
six hydrogen atoms.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:04.020
So in this case, our, I can
write this again as one delta

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:14.860
H1 is six times the carbon
hydrogen bond energy plus the

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:20.320
carbon carbon bond energy that
we'd like to determine.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.760
And again we can go through
now a similar cycle.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.100
So again this now can be
equilibrated with carbon

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:39.770
graphite plus three molecules of
hydrogen in the gas phase,

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.950
just like before.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.230
And so from that we can see
that we'll end up with an

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:51.740
equality between these, and
negative delta H naught

00:11:51.740 --> 00:12:05.140
formation for C2H6 or ethane,
plus two delta H of carbon

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.940
atomization, plus three
delta H for

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:17.920
atomization hydrogen molecule.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.880
So we've already seen we could
look up these numbers and

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.170
this, and we've already
determined a carbon hydrogen

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.120
bond energy.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.790
So again, if we find all the
relevant values, we can

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.020
determine that our carbon carbon
bond energy is 342

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:43.020
kilojoules.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:43.690
And so on.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.860
So we can keep going and again
build up a bigger and bigger

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.980
inventory of bond energies just
to provide us with the

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.140
kind of intuition that we'd
like to have to be able to

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.240
think about ordinary molecular
energetics.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.740
Any questions about
bond energies?

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.140
All right.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.250
Of course, if we know bond
energies, we also could make

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.580
estimates of heats
of formation.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.650
So if we have some new compound,
we don't know its

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.770
heat of formation, we
know its structure.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.570
We know what bonds
are involved.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.900
We could get an estimate for
what we might expect for its

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.760
heat of formation if we know
those, and I think I'll just

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.830
write this out on the board by
example, but not work through

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.960
the numbers explicitly.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:31.190
You know, let's say we were
going to make, you know, n

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.360
pentane C5H12.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:50.020
And of course again keeping
proper track of all the carbon

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.650
carbon and carbon
hydrogen bonds.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.190
But now in principle we know
the carbon carbon bond

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.980
energies and the carbon hydrogen
bond energies.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.330
So we should be able to figure
out the heat of formation of a

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.900
compound like this, even if we
don't know it from a table.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.170
And it's again through a similar
sort of cycle so if we

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.510
start with the atoms in the gas

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:19.290
phase, and go to n pentane.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:25.810
So this is now the bond
energies which

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:29.350
we basically know.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:40.810
And again make our cycle of
involving the elements in

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:45.420
their stable form at standard
temperature and pressure.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:55.290
Then again, here's our
one, two, three.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:15:02.160
Here's our minus delta H of
atomization, and here's our

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:11.940
heat of formation.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.080
And that's the point, is that
now we can use what we've

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.300
already elaborated for the bond
energies and the known

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.000
enthalpies of atomization,
and we could

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.050
determine the heat of formation.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:33.760
If we do that, we wind up with
a value of minus 152.6

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:40.580
kilojoules.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.340
If we measure it.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:51.870
If we look up in a table what
the actual value is, we

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:59.530
discover it's minus
146.4 kilojoules.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.700
So it's a few percent off.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.510
Why is it off?

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.130
Why isn't it right?

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:11.180
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.080
PROFESSOR NELSON:
Yes, exactly.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.300
You know you can't use the C-H
bonds from methane for every

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.990
C-H bond, or the C-C bond in
ethane for every carbon carbon

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.960
single bond.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.810
There'll be variations, usually
of modest magnitude,

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.350
in the values.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.910
So this isn't going to be an
exact calculation, but

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.910
certainly this is close enough
for allowing us to think

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.640
qualitatively and
semi-quantitatively about

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.830
ordinary energetics.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:56.370
Another illustration of it is if
we look at neopentane -- so

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.070
same chemical formula.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:02.060
Same number of carbon carbon
and carbon hydrogen bonds.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.530
So according to the way we've
done this calculation, we

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:08.180
should get exactly the same
number, because all we're

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.970
doing is adding up the total
number of bonds,

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.870
and it's the same.

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.790
But what we discover is that
for neopentane, delta H of

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:28.080
formation, neopentane is
minus 166.1 kilojoules.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.550
So again it's different
in this case

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.560
in the other direction.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.200
But certainly close enough
that allows us to think

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.870
reasonably about what might
happen in ordinary situations.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:47.770
Any questions about
bond energies?

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:55.700
OK, now we're going to go to a
new topic, and let me say, the

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.680
topic we're going to start now,
the second law, is really

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.120
in a sense, this is the start of
the whole rest of the term.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.180
So far, what we've covered
essentially is conservation of

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.330
energy, how you think about
energetics and what

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.320
contributes to them.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.800
That is heat and work.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.960
How to account for them
all properly.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.890
What happens under constant
volume or constant pressure

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.280
conditions that led us to the
definition of enthalpy right

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.360
and so forth.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.270
And once you get your arms
around these ideas, and it

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.640
takes some work to do that, but
once you do, the actual

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.110
execution of things can be
pretty straightforward, and

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.440
some of this can seem like
just you know a lot of

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.460
accounting.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.040
It's not.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.750
It takes some effort to become
accustomed to it and familiar

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.070
with how to properly think about
heat and work and how

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.380
they contribute to energy
and so forth.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.570
But given that amount of effort,
a lot of this can be

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.490
reduced to fairly
straightforward

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.430
calculational stuff.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:09.640
What we're about to start is a
little different from that in

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.870
some sense, and really in some
ways more difficult because

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:20.230
what we're going to try to
understand starting with this

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:25.910
next set of topics is what
determines whether something

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.020
happens spontaneously?

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.650
We haven't really talked about
that in any of this.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.680
We've talked about whether
reactions are endothermic or

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.190
exothermic.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.180
But as you're going to see that
doesn't determine what

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.750
happens spontaneously.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.010
It certainly is one of the
factors, but by no

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.180
means the only one.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.760
What determines what happens
just by itself?

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.970
Or another way of saying that
is, if I have some sort of

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.290
system, it could be an engine.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.830
It could be a chemical
reaction.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.560
It could be a biochemical system
or some part of it.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:07.660
What determines where the
equilibrium is and the

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.320
direction that things would have
to go in order to reach

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.280
or approach the equilibrium?

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.990
What is the equilibrium
state of something?

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.350
Actually, what we've discussed
so far really doesn't allow us

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.630
to determine that, and there are
a few easy ways to sort of

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.590
bring that out.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:35.130
One is you can imagine
constructing some kind of

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:42.710
cyclic process that you know
it could remove heat like a

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:49.453
refrigerator does from a cool
region and export the heat to

00:20:49.453 --> 00:20:51.910
a hotter region, like the room,
or outside a window if

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.320
it's an air conditioner or
something like that.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.820
Just move the heat.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.770
That's it.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.210
Why not?

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.000
I mean you could do that
and not necessarily

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.030
violate the first law.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.060
Or what about, here's
a simpler case.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:16.690
What if I just have a chamber
with a divider, and I pump out

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:22.090
half of it, and I put gas in
this half, so there's gas and

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:29.770
there's vacuum, and then
I remove the divider.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.500
So I certainly expect that what
happens is the gas fills

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:34.970
the volume.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.640
Why?

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.230
The first law didn't tell me
that that needs to happen.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.500
Why doesn't it go back the
other way, anyway, even

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.330
without the barrier?

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.360
Why doesn't the gas just by
itself all wind up over here?

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.845
Let's say it's a pretty dilute
gas, so even if it does all

00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:56.430
end up in this half, you know
the energy of any sort of

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.970
unfavorable repulsions between
molecules is negligible.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.660
Maybe they even have
weak attractions?

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.530
Why doesn't that happened?

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.530
It's a good thing for us
that it doesn't happen.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.250
Why in this room doesn't the air
all just sort of collect

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.820
over there somewhere?

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.010
Or just the oxygen molecules
in the air and

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.130
suffocate all of us.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.540
The first law doesn't
have anything to

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.730
say about that actually.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.390
Whatever the reason it doesn't
happen, we're not going to

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:30.200
find the answer to that
in the first law.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.330
So that's what the second law
of thermodynamics and the

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.540
development of entropy
is all about.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.200
It's to help us understand
what is the direction of

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.590
spontaneous change?

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.650
What governs that, and what's
the equilibrium state that is

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:51.280
reached when the spontaneous
change occurs?

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.000
OK?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.590
So the second law is going to
give us basically a principle

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.060
that'll tell us the direction
of spontaneous change.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.610
One way of thinking about that
is it's going to allow it to

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.610
sort of determine the
direction of time.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.090
You know if we see initial or if
we see one state and we see

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.370
another state, we'll be able or
know, time must have been

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:15.070
going this way, right because
the spontaneous change would

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:19.720
happen in this direction.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:30.470
So, I'm going to put up a couple
of just statements of

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.110
the second law of
thermodynamics.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:38.160
I'll start with kind
of an easy one.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:56.400
So maybe I'll start
with that here.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:08.760
Here's a statement
by Clausius.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.390
The first law says that
the energy of

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:16.750
the universe is constant.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:34.780
We're always conserving
in one way or another.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:57.320
And the second law is that the
entropy of the universe is

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.600
increasing.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.350
Now we're going to define
entropy presently.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.340
But I'm writing this up just to
give you some foreshadowing

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.350
of how we're going to try to
guide our thinking about

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.310
spontaneous processes.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:17.200
This tells us about conservation
of energy.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.240
This tells us about which
direction things move in

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.700
spontaneously, namely the
direction that leads to an

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:33.390
increase in this soon to be
defined quantity entropy.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:38.010
It's going to turn out to be a
state function, and it'll help

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.370
us understand the direction
of spontaneous change.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:46.300
You know, like the first law
the second law too was

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.300
developed before there was
a very well defined

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.620
understanding of the molecular
nature of matter.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.360
We're going to talk about the
second law and entropy in

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.470
macroscopic terms.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.650
Later on in the semester we'll
also discuss them in

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.300
microscopic terms.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.330
We'll do a little bit of what's
called statistical

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.090
mechanics, of microscopic,
basically discussing the

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.200
microscopic origins of
entropy in terms

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.340
of disorder of molecules.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.420
But really, the thermodynamics
of entropy and the second law

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.140
evolved because people were
trying to build things.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.350
It was the Industrial
Revolution. people were trying

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.370
to build engines, steam engines,
and other kinds of

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.890
devices, refrigerators
other things.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.680
And they couldn't understand --
first of all, why couldn't

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.550
you make it perfectly
efficient?

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.920
You know, you'd have
a steam engine.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.260
There'd be a source of heat.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.180
You could extract work.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.870
Never seemed like you
could get it all and

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.280
turn it all into work.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.270
Why not?

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.940
And if not, what were the
limitations on it?

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.020
What was the best efficiency
you could achieve?

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.170
So in a very practical way
people were motivated to think

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:12.570
very hard about these
kinds of questions.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.880
So let's just look at some of
the things that brought out

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.540
the need for this kind
of consideration.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:38.090
So let me start by drawing one
of the impossibilities.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.890
We could try to build
a heat engine.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:49.190
Where we've got some temperature
T1 which is hot,

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:54.380
and some amount of heat, q1 goes
into our system, and our

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.470
system runs as a cycle.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.410
It goes around and around,
because in any practical

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.910
situation we're going to need
to keep going and repeating

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.080
the process.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.400
Some amount of work comes out.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.670
We'll call it minus w, because
work is always defined as the

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.760
work that's done by the
environment on the system.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.060
So if I'm drawing the arrow this
way, then I want to write

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:27.740
it as minus w.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.510
Now this would be just swell.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.070
This is it.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.690
That's the whole heat engine.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.330
This is running in a cycle.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:41.610
So we know that, delta
u is zero.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.130
So that would mean that, you
know, the amount of work out

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:51.110
would just equal the heat
in every time around.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:54.520
Never happens.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.510
Can't make it happen.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:02.310
The only way it works is
if instead there's

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:12.250
an additional part.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:27.200
Somewhere heat is also lost
to a cold reservoir.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.390
In other words, you know
I burned some fuel.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.810
I consumed something to produce
my hot source, and I'm

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.600
going to then try to turn it
into work, which I can, but

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.700
only partly.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.890
There's going to be heat loss
somewhere to a colder region,

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.650
and I can't avoid it.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:53.910
And it was discovered that
this was always the case.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:59.950
So this can be built where, just
to be clear on these. q1

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.820
is a positive number, because
again that's heat going from

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.570
the environment to the system.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:19.970
This is our system running
in a cycle.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:26.370
So q1 is positive, minus w is
positive, that is work is

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:31.230
being done on the environment
by the engine.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:42.740
And minus q2 is positive.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:51.330
And T1 is greater than T2.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:55.630
That I can build.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.460
Here's another thing
we could try to do.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.550
It's sort of the opposite.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.840
We could try to produce a
refrigerator but not have to

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.220
do any work.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:13.730
So let's go the other way, in
other words, let's go from T2

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:20.220
which is cold we're going to
go in this direction now,

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:26.050
which means q2 will be a
positive number and here's our

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.600
system running in a cycle.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.000
And now here's minus q1 now is
going to be our positive

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.590
number, and we're going to
remove heat from q2 and move

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:43.660
it, or from T2 a cold region
and move it to some place

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.110
that's hotter.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.960
Also a pretty nice idea.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.790
And also obviously impossible.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:59.770
It only works if I put work in
there to make it happen, then

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:04.620
yes I can take heat out of a
cold body and move it up into

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:11.970
a hotter reservoir
of some sort.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:21.560
So here's a refrigerator.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:28.450
Again T1 is greater than T2,
and in this case q2 is

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.280
greater than zero.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:37.340
I'm removing heat, minus q1 is
greater than zero, that is

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:44.460
heat is going up this way.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.900
Work is greater than zero.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.950
Has to be.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:55.310
Of course the thing is running
in a cycle. delta u is zero.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:33:09.390
So that means that work must
be minus q1 plus q2, right?

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.870
And work is greater than zero,
so that's saying minus q1

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.490
right that's a positive
number, must

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.440
be bigger than q2.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.150
In other words, I am taking
some heat away

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.120
from the cold region.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.780
The heat I'm dumping into the
hotter region is bigger than

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.340
the amount that I taking away
here, because it's also got

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:33.700
this amount.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.400
That's why, you know, if it's
a humid or warm summer

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.190
afternoon and you think oh what
I a great idea, I've got

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:42.770
this little fridge in my room.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:47.140
I'm going to open it up
and cool the room off.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.700
Turns out not to
work too well.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.920
Because of course what
the fridge is

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.670
doing, it's cold inside.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:57.440
So it's a machine that's
removing heat from the inside

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.960
and dumping it outside.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.630
There are coils in the back of
the fridge, and if you touch

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.840
them they're a little
bit warm and so on.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:09.810
The heat is being lost
to the room.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:10.510
How much heat?

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:14.950
Well, the work that goes
in is also added.

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:17.170
So the amount of heat that
goes out into the room is

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.010
bigger than the amount of
heat that you're taking

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.040
away from the space.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.990
That's bad.

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:26.530
So if you try opening the
refrigerator door to cool off

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.750
your room at the same time as
you're dumping heat into your

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.720
room, all you discover is
the net effect is to

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:35.150
heat up your room.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:38.030
Because you know the amount
of heat that the thing is

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.130
removing from somewhere on the
inside there and struggling to

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.470
do that because you've left the
door to the fridge open,

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:46.970
right, is not as big as the
amount out heat that's coming

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:49.670
out in those coils
on the back.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.540
It's not as big because that
heat has not only the heat

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.760
that you're removing from
the inside, but also

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.300
this amount of work.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.970
It's all conserved because
delta u is zero.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.910
The thing is running
in a cycle.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.680
Try it sometime.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.940
You can verify this
experimentally in a very

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:07.920
simple way.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.130
It's not a very effective way
to work, and it wastes a

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.650
little bit of energy, but
could be worth it in the

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:18.480
interest of knowledge
and discovery.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.080
Let me write an alternate
statement of the

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:35.080
second law of Clausius.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:49.100
All spontaneous processes
are irreversible.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:54.550
When I open that panel in the
container, I've got gas on one

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:58.650
side and vacuum in the other
and it expands in there, it

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:03.500
happens spontaneously, and
it's irreversible.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:11.770
It's not just going
to go back.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:14.810
And now let me write a
mathematical statement of the

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:28.370
second law.

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.620
And we'll celebrate
it's importance

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:38.490
by using this color.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:44.460
Going around in a cycle, if I
integrate the quantity dq

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:50.690
reversible over T, I get zero.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:55.970
Remember this, this is
our special function.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.930
Let me just keep going
a little more though.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:02.210
Let me also write
another version.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:09.310
If I write dq for an
irreversible path over T,

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:16.190
right, less than zero.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:22.380
It's not the same.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:28.300
This is a state function.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.380
This isn't.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.500
Remember of course that the heat
that's exchange between

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:36.890
the system and the environment
depends on the path.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:42.280
If there is a reversible path,
and you see how much heat was

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.410
exchange with the environment,
and you look at that divided

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:50.390
by temperature integrate over
the whole thing, you discover

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:56.940
that as long as the path is
reversible, it only depends on

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.310
the states at the beginning
and the end of the path.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.780
In other words if you have
various ways you can go from

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:06.030
state one to two that
are reversible,

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.090
it's always the same.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:11.970
We saw that for just a
couple of examples, a

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.430
couple lectures back.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.690
Remember, we looked at these
thermodynamic cycles and just

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:18.320
said, well let's just
calculate those.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.700
And those were, those all
involved reversible processes.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.170
So, in effect, we looked at
different paths to go from one

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.230
state to another.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.580
We had a cycle, and one path
went to here, and the other

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.170
path went back.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:35.210
We discovered that, in fact,
this one zero around the cycle

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:38.400
or the way we expressed it at
the time is the value of this

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.120
was the same regardless of the
way we got from one state to

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.740
the other, whether we took a
straightforward route or a

00:38:44.740 --> 00:39:09.800
more circuitous route, as long
as they were reversible.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:28.950
We're going to define dS as dq
reversible over T, and since

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:35.260
we're dealing with a state
function delta S going from

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:46.060
state one to two of dq
reversible over T is S2 minus

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:52.630
S1 state function.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:40:03.650
And S as state function is the
entropy, and of course the us,

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:19.880
it will always be special.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:27.480
All right, now, the second law,
you know it's difficult

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.020
to understand and to get your
arms around, because you know,

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.350
do I really calculate this?

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:36.990
I actually have to find a
reversible path in order to do

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.860
the calculation.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:43.460
Normally, you know, when you
calculate delta u and delta h

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:48.190
and so forth, you have various
ways to calculate them that

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.580
can be pretty straightforward.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.600
But here, you actually have to
determine the heat exchanged

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.730
between the system and the
environment, and you know that

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:02.840
does, in general, depend
on the path.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:07.390
But it turns out that this
quantity, you know, the

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:13.970
differential of that heat over
the temperature, also depends

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:18.410
on path unless it's
a reversible pass.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.370
Any reversible path will lead
to the same results.

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:26.650
It doesn't depend on path
among reversible paths.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:30.200
What that means in practice is
if we say OK, start here and

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.680
end here and calculate the
entropy, you actually have to

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.510
sort of figure out a reversible
way of getting from

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:41.900
here to here so that you can
do that calculation.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.520
So it's really very different
from ordinary functions that

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:50.990
you've been dealing with.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.250
A lot of people, you know,
because the second law is

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:59.010
difficult to understand, you
know you can easily go online

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.900
and see thousands of violations
of the second law.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:06.110
It's still easy to look, to go
find claims of perpetual

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:08.230
motion machines.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.140
Some of them cost
a lot of money.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:13.600
You can buy them, see
how they work.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:20.400
But and also, all sorts of
schemes for producing energy.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.650
Go online and see, right.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.000
You're just, they're just crazy
ideas about getting

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.920
energy from nothing.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.500
Getting energy from the heat
that's just already

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.650
present in the air.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:33.770
I mean there's heat in the air,
all this motion, it must

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:34.400
have energy.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:40.330
We should be able to extract
it and use it.

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:43.850
Turns out we can't do that.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:50.460
It has to look something
like this.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.530
OK.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.430
I want to look at some more
statements of the second law.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:43:00.340
To do that I just want to
indicate one definition which

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:04.030
is just to be clear what
these things mean.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:08.530
These are what I've called
heat reservoirs

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.800
or hot or cold bodies.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.020
Here's what I mean to
be more specific.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:20.400
A heat reservoir is basically
a very large thermal mass at

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.430
the same temperature.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:25.080
And the real idea is that you
can bring heat out of it as

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:30.410
much as you want and the
temperature won't change.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:33.350
It's an idealization. right If
you have something that's big

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:36.120
enough, and it's at a constant
temperature, of course you can

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.140
take heat away, but it's just
so enormous that you won't

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:41.800
measurably change it's
temperature.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:47.740
In practice you might be able
or approach that limit.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:58.070
OK, now let's look at some more
definitions or statements

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:19.990
of the second law.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:27.930
This is from Kelvin of Kelvin
temperature scale fame.

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:35.860
It's impossible to convert heat
into work with a system

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.110
that operates in a cycle.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:38.300
I'm going to write
this all out.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.650
I know you've got it
in your notes too,

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.230
but it's super important.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:45:02.810
To convert heat into work with
a system that operates in a

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:08.570
cycle, without at the same time
transferring some heat to

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:31.430
a colder reservoir.

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:34.590
OK, a couple of things
to notice.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:37.500
One is, you know, in some sense
the second law is kind

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.710
of negative, right?

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:44.670
Must not have been done
in the new age.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:49.060
It tells us what we can't do.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.610
And that really is in a sense
what it's all about.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:56.340
It's telling us what are our
limitations of what can be

00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.960
accomplished.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:09.480
Very important part of this
statement -- in a cycle.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.460
Of course any practical engine
has to keep going, so there's

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:16.110
going to be a cycle in some
way or another, but it's

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:19.990
important because, you know,
there are some -- if I'm not

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:21.730
operating in a cycle,
I can convert heat

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:24.470
into work just fine.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:34.190
You know, I could have a heat
source, got a candle, and I've

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:38.410
got a piston, maybe I've
got a weight on it.

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:45.000
I've got something
stopping it.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.970
And then I remove the stoppers
and let it go, and because of

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:51.250
the heat, there's expansion.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:47:04.810
It pushes up, right, and it'll
be up higher somewhere.

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:05.880
Worked!

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.580
Heat turned into work.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.740
I don't have a cold
body somewhere.

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.060
But I only did this once.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.690
There was just one stroke
of the piston.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:17.830
If I want to continue it and run
in a cycle, somehow I've

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:31.550
got to have a place where
the heat goes.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:37.910
So this sort of diagram
describes effectively the way

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:41.440
the Kelvin statement works.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.290
This works fine and like we
illustrated before, it doesn't

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:50.000
work fine if I don't have
this part of it.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.740
I won't be able to just take all
the heat and convert it to

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:58.170
work, like I, in principle,
could do, if I don't need to

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:13.650
run it in a cycle.

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:17.200
Here is yet another statement
by Clausius And we'll

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:25.100
end with that one.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.950
Maybe I'll just read
this one, so we can

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.630
not go over the time.

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:32.960
So, it's impossible for any
system to operate in a cycle

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:38.630
that takes heat from a colder
reservoir, transfers it to a

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:42.690
hotter reservoir, without at the
same time converting some

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.630
work into heat.

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.700
In other words, it's a statement
kind of similar to

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.720
the Kelvin statement, but
applying to the case of moving

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.350
heat from a colder to
a hotter region.

00:48:55.350 --> 00:49:01.230
Can't do it, unless some work is
also converted to the heat

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:14.110
that gets released into
the hot region.

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:15.610
I think we'll stop there.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:21.560
Next time what we'll do is lay
out a very well-defined kind

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.070
of engine called Carnot cycle
that allows us to very

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:27.700
explicitly go through and say
OK, let's just work out the

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:32.020
steps of isothermal and
adiabatic expansions and

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:32.850
contractions.

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:35.310
In other words, how does
the engine really work?

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:39.000
And just calculate it going
around in a cycle and see

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.290
exactly how all this
is born out.

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:43.260
And we'll see that next time.
