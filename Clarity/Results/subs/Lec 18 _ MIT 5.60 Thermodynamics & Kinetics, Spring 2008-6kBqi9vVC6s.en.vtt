00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.200
PROFESSOR: Today I want
to start us off on a

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.820
somewhat new topic.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.530
Which is phase equilibria.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.810
So, recently you've been
looking at chemical

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.330
equilibria.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.870
What happens when substances
change their chemical

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.270
structure and interchange, and
you've figured out how to

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.480
calculate where equilibrium
lies in the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.200
case of chemical reactions.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.830
Calculate equilibrium constants,
and so forth.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.060
Now we'll introduce
phase equilibria.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.340
So this is a little
bit different.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.100
You still have a lot of
molecules in one state

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.480
changing to another state, but
they're not changing their own

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.320
molecular structure.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.470
They're changing what phase
of matter they're in.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.580
From liquid to solid to gas.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.900
And so the treatment is a
little bit different.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.010
And there's some new results
that are somewhat different

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.250
from what you've seen in the
case of chemical reactions.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:15.830
So we'll start with phase
equilibria in just one

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:26.190
component system.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.900
So in other words, we're going
to start with a single

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.830
substance and see how it goes
from solid to liquid to gas.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.550
And we'll from there
see what happens in

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.990
multiple component systems.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.240
Where, for example, then we'll
be able to talk about

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.370
solubility and mixtures of
liquids and so forth.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.470
And into which phase different
constituents in a

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.030
mixture will go.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.330
But let's start here.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:58.480
So, let's say we just have two
phases at equilibrium.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:07.350
And this could just look
like ice and water.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.180
You could have a little bit
of ice floating in water.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:23.820
So in this case you have
solid and liquid.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.380
That could be in equilibrium.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.070
And this is going to be at some
pressure and temperature.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.130
Or, you could have liquid
and gas in equilibrium.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.530
So let's put a lid
on our container.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.690
Still have some specified
pressure and temperature.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.430
And now there's a liquid
at the bottom.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.720
And a gas at the top.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:59.490
So, you could have equilibrium
between liquid and gas phases.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.110
And in some cases you have
equilibrium between solid and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:22.150
gas phases, depending
on the pressure.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.030
And and a little piece of solid
could sit at the bottom

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.220
and there's equilibrium
with the gas above it.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.050
And so, to start, what quantity
are we going to need

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.100
to look at to tell whether the
different phases are in

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.660
equilibrium, or if they're not
in equilibrium, in which

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.210
direction are things
going to go?

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.870
Are things going to change so
that the ice will melt and

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.970
we'll have water or, so
the water will freeze

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.590
and we'll have ice.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.290
What quantity is going to
tell us about all that?

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.000
Who thinks they can guess?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.500
Give you a hint.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.750
We're specifying pressure
and temperature.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.420
Nobody really knows?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.800
What quantity is it that you've
seen from which you can

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.020
determine everything.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.170
Yes.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:25.770
The Gibbs free energy is going
to tell us everything.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.230
And we're going to frame the
discussion in terms of the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.320
chemical potential.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:43.150
That is, the Gibbs free
energy for a mole.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.350
And since there's only one
constituent, one component at

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.930
this point, we just have n.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.100
We don't have different mole
numbers for different

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.430
constituents, we'll
see that later.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.380
OK, so what's going to happen
is, the value of the chemical

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.000
potential in the different
phases is going to tell us

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.060
everything.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.430
Because you know that at
equilibrium, the chemical

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.320
potential needs to be the
same in all of these.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.350
If not, let's say the potential
energy here is lower

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.930
in the solid than in the gas,
nothing's going to stop the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.780
molecules in the gas
phase from going

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.640
into the solid phase.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.150
That's what they'll do.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.750
If the chemical potential of
the water is lower than the

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.850
chemical potential of the ice,
then the ice is going to melt.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.770
Because the molecules are going
to want to go toward

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.000
lowest possible accessible
chemical potential.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.200
And there's the liquid
right there.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.850
They have access to it, so they
can, the ice will melt.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:48.570
And you'll have just water.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:06:03.760
So the main point here is that
at equilibrium, mu is

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:11.240
identical everywhere.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.960
By everywhere, I mean in
all phases that are at

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.800
equilibrium.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.550
And so if multiple phases are
present, mu has to be the same

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.960
in all the phases.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.780
And if it isn't, then the
molecules will go into the

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:54.340
phase with the lower
chemical potential.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.430
And this is what is going to
guide everything in our

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.340
consideration of phase
equilibrium.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.940
So, OK, what's going
to happen?

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.780
Let's consider our ice
water equilibrium.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:24.170
So of course, if mu of the solid
is equal to mu of the

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:31.190
liquid, which for water it
should happen at zero degrees

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.800
Centigrade.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:38.050
And pressure of one bar, for
example, not the only place it

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.490
could happen.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.110
But certainly at
that condition.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.210
Then the ice and water
will be in

00:07:47.210 --> 00:08:01.480
equilibrium, they'll co-exist.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.660
Now, what happens if you just
want some ice water and you

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.466
take some ice out of the freezer
and put it in the cup,

00:08:06.466 --> 00:08:08.550
and you put some water in?

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.540
And you see them both there.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.930
They're sitting there.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.940
Maybe for a while.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.060
And yet it's not
at zero degrees

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.420
Centigrade, at one bar.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.085
It may be at one bar, you might
be out in the room, but

00:08:20.085 --> 00:08:24.050
it might be room temperature.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.440
Does that tell us that
this isn't true?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.780
What's going to happen?

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.700
The ice is going to melt.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.520
It may take a while.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.480
This doesn't tell us about
the kinetics of it.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.880
And it could take a while,
gradually, from the surface

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.660
inward, for the ice to melt.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.020
So the fact that you might see
something sitting there with

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.130
two phases present, that alone
of course, doesn't tell you

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.970
the two phases are
in equilibrium.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:57.480
And it may take time for
equilibrium to occur.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:05.480
And what's going to happen
if at some pressure and

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:12.890
temperature, you have the mu s
greater than mu of the liquid.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.070
Then which way are things
going to go?

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:19.200
What's going to happen?

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.190
You've got to be able
to figure this out.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:30.290
Of course.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.150
The ice is going to melt.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.380
The chemical potential of
the liquid is lower.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.180
And so molecules are going to
move toward that phase.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:48.340
And, of course, if mu solid less
than mu liquid, then the

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.650
water freezes.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:55.350
All this behavior is something
that we can summarize in a

00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:03.310
phase diagram.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:09.660
So the phase diagram can tell
us for all pressures and

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:15.050
temperatures, what phase, or
what phases, will be present

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.850
in equilibrium.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:28.740
And so typically, phase diagram
might look like this.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.790
Where here's our solid.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.410
Here's our liquid.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.930
Here's our gas phase.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:39.010
So let's just look at what's
happening here.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.640
If we go to really low
temperature, in

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.790
general, what happens?

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.310
What phase does stuff enter
when you're at the lowest

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.320
accessible temperatures?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:47.900
Solid, right?

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.190
Everything eventually freezes.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:55.670
In fact, really I should make
this, leave some room on my

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.130
axis for that effect.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.780
So of course, low temperature
you get solid.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.540
How about high pressure,
what usually happens?

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.660
You squeeze something
real hard.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.900
Tends to go into the
solid phase.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.880
Now let's warm stuff up.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.020
And depending on the pressure,
you might go

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.920
to the liquid phase.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.900
Certainly you'll go to the
gas phase at high enough

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.580
temperature.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.400
And that's what'll happen.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.880
And now, if you start changing
the pressure, let's say you're

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.350
at high temperature and you've
got just the gas present, in

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.140
some big container.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.380
Now you start squeezing it.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.100
You just apply more and more
pressure to the gas at

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.900
constant temperature.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.510
What's going to happen?

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.660
Forget the phase diagram.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.400
You know what's going
to happen.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:49.630
You keep squeezing, what
will happen eventually?

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.500
This isn't going to be
part of your grade.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.810
You can speak up loud, and
even if you're completely

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:58.900
wrong, nothing bad is going
to happen to you.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.430
Yeah.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.100
It's going to liquefy,
of course.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.770
You're going to start getting
liquid to form.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.600
It's essentially Le Chatelier's

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.070
principle, of course.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.860
The liquid occupies
less volume.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.600
The density of the liquid
is much higher.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.290
So as you increase the pressure,
the stuff wants to

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.780
go from the gas phase
to the liquid phase.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:12.980
Yeah.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.880
PROFESSOR: Well, with water
you know that at ordinary

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.860
pressure, you know where
the gas-liquid

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.100
coexistence would occur.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.220
So let's say you're there.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.500
Let's say you're at
the boiling point.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.620
And now, you already in some
sense know that that's a point

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.500
that's somewhere on the
gas-liquid curve.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.970
So now what's going to happen?

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.470
Well, if you from there keep
that temperature constant.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.970
You're at the boiling point.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.180
And you could easily do this.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.970
You've got a pot that's
covered, right?

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.430
And it's boiling.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.070
So there's liquid down here
and there's gas here.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.130
So what'll happen?

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.890
As you start squeezing,
literally what'll happen is

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.070
you'll squeeze out all
the room for the gas.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.300
And eventually you'll
have all liquid.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.820
And in fact, you know what'll
happen at that point, if you

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.310
keep squeezing and you
keep the heat on.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.280
The liquid will get hotter
than the boiling point.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.710
Normally that doesn't happen,
if you're just out at

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:16.530
atmospheric pressure.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.630
Because it'll boil.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.360
And instead of getting hotter,
molecules will simply leave

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.520
the liquid and go into
the gas phase.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.670
So that's what'll happen.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.860
If you increase the pressure,
you'll liquefy all the gas.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.120
And obviously the opposite
will also occur.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.510
If you just allow the volume to
expand and keep expanding,

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.140
maybe you don't have too much
liquid there, you wouldn't

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.600
have to expand it too much.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.390
You'll run out, all the
liquid will vaporize.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:49.090
And you'll just have gas at 100
degrees C. You could heat

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.710
it more if you wanted,
but even there.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.630
So in other words, changing
the pressure if you think

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.120
about actually executing that
in the lab, or in this case

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.370
even in your kitchen, you'll get
the result that you should

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.060
see on the phase diagram.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.100
So let's just look at this.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.850
So we've already talked
about boiling.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:14.000
That's what's happening
along this line.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.470
The line, and I'll explain the
end of this in a while, all

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:28.070
these lines are coexistence
curves.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.440
That is, these are
where you have

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.380
equilibrium between two phases.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:38.360
They coexist in equilibrium. and
it could happen for water,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.400
for that case, for 100 degrees
C and one bar.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.840
But that's not the only place.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.250
It could happen it
a whole bunch of

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.150
temperatures and pressure.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.750
Because as you vary the
pressure, you're almost surely

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.850
familiar with this, the
boiling point changes.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.300
So the boiling point up in
Denver at high elevation is

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.800
not the same as the boiling
point here in Massachusetts

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.020
right at sea level.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:08.710
Because the pressure's
lower up in Denver.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:09.770
Let's just look at the others.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.910
So, of course, this is going
from solid to liquid.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.990
So we're looking at melting.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.680
And then there is solid-gas
equilibria in many cases.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:29.450
And this is sublimation.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:38.750
And this endpoint is called
the critical point.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:43.730
And there's one point where
all three phases are in

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:51.740
equilibrium, called
the triple point.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.010
So let's look at the
various cases.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.280
For example, let's look
at the melting line.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.190
It could be water, it could
be water and ice.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.900
Solid going to a liquid.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.420
Let's just look at them
one at a time.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.900
What you have there is mu of the
solid at some temperature

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.990
and pressure.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.650
Is equal to mu of the
liquid at the same

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.270
temperature and pressure.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.660
Now, just if we back off and
look at this essentially

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.260
mathematically, there's
an equation here.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.830
And there are two
free variables.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.020
Temperature and pressure.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.170
The equation puts a constraint
on them.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.950
So there are going to be a bunch
of solutions along some

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.660
line or some curve.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:44.800
So in other words, it's one
equation in two unknowns.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:53.330
Temperature and pressure.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:17:01.160
So the solution is a
line or a curve.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:08.710
In other words, we could solve
for pressure as a function of

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:13.820
temperature, or temperatures
as a function of pressure,

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.780
along the coexistence curve.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:24.600
And we'll do that shortly.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:32.740
Now, if we're in one of these
regions, then there aren't any

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.630
equalities.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.510
There aren't any constraints.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.890
Because we don't have multiple
chemical potentials that are

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:45.510
equal to each other.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.990
Right here we have three
phases in chemical

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.980
equilibrium.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.620
Solid, liquid and gas.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:18:00.370
So let's just look at
that triple point.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:12.470
Mu solid equals mu liquid
equals mu of the gas.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.390
We have two unknowns,
or two variables,

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.880
temperature and pressure.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.560
And we have two equations.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.040
What that means is there's only
one solution, and that's

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.860
what the phase diagram shows.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.810
There's a unique solution, the
triple point temperature and

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.520
the triple point pressure.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:48.480
So this has only one solution.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.520
If we summarize, how many
degrees of freedom, or how

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.610
many free variables, we have,
anywhere here, we can do that

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.640
in the following way.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.060
We can write F is 3 minus p.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:16.850
This is the number of
degrees of freedom.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:22.880
Or independent variables.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:33.200
And this is the number of
phases in equilibrium.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.020
So, what's it telling us?

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.270
If we have just one phase in
equilibrium, or way over in

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.550
the solid or just gas
or just liquid part

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.670
of the phase diagram.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.610
This is one.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.310
We have two independent
variables.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.240
Which is exactly what we
know to be the case.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.200
In other words, in those
regions, temperature and

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.980
pressure can vary freely
without constraints.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.120
If we go to any of the
coexistence curves, now we

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.210
have two phases in
equilibrium.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:11.570
And then only one variable
can be changed freely.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.700
If we want to stay on the
coexistence curve, let's say

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.410
we've got gas and liquid
in equilibrium.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.130
It's boiling.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.800
We could change the pressure
some, but if we want to keep

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.500
them in equilibrium, if we've
changed the pressure, we'd

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.920
better change the temperature
accordingly to stay on the

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.980
coexistence curve.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.230
Otherwise everything will
go up into the liquid or

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.460
into the gas phase.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.940
Because you'll go off of the
coexistence curve if you were

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.480
to change one of these variables
and not the other.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.390
In other words, there's
a constraint.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.430
So only one can vary freely.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.890
And if all three phases are in
equilibrium at the triple

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.600
point, then you have no
degrees of freedom.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.210
Nothing can vary and
there's only one

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:59.910
place where that happens.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:04.960
Now let's see if we can
understand also, why does the

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.830
whole thing have the overall
structure that it does.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:12.070
Why are some of the slopes
generally steeper than others.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.220
Turns out, we can get a
qualitative understanding of

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:20.360
phase equilibria in a
pretty simple way.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:41.850
So in other words, can we
understand how p and T change

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.870
with respect to each other
along any one of these

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.700
coexistence curves?

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.440
Can we understand the
qualitative features of the

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.820
phase diagrams?

00:21:54.820 --> 00:22:03.900
And what we'll see is, we can
get an equation for dp/dT at

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.760
coexistence.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.650
That's, in a sense, our
objective here in order to get

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:14.010
the sort of qualitative
picture.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.870
So let's say we are
somewhere here.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.140
It could be the gas-solid
part.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:29.130
And we have some T. And now we
go to T plus dT, and out here

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.800
is pressure.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:37.300
How much does the pressure
change when we stay on the

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:44.790
coexistence curve?

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.250
Well, let's go through this.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.830
Let's just consider any two
phases, alpha and beta.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:23:04.900
They could be solid,
liquid, gas.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.830
And the main condition, if
we're going to be on the

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.000
coexistence curve, is
that the chemical

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:22.480
potentials have to be equal.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.190
Well, that's fine.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:45.050
Now let's change the conditions
a little bit.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.870
Staying on the coexistence
curve.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:56.546
So, let's start again. mu s,
or mu alpha of T and p is

00:23:56.546 --> 00:24:04.620
equal to mu beta at T and p.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:12.260
Now let's let temperature go to
T plus dT, and pressure go

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.480
to p plus dp.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.220
But since we're staying on the
coexistence curve still, at

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.570
the new temperature and
pressure, mu alpha and beta

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.600
have to be equal
to each other.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:30.390
So mu alpha is going to go to
mu alpha plus d mu alpha.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.790
There'll be some change in it.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:40.690
Mu beta is going to go to
mu beta plus d mu beta.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.980
But we already have that mu
alpha and mu beta at the

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.360
beginning were equal
to each other.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.260
And these have to be equal
to each other.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.930
Because we've specified that
we're staying on the

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.070
coexistence curve.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:25:03.600
So what that says is d mu
alpha equals d mu beta.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:12.370
And now, remember in general
d mu is dG per mole, so our

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:19.840
fundamental equation for G, it's
minus S per mole dT plus

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.490
molar volume dp.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:38.190
So this equality is telling us
that minus S alpha dT plus V

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:51.300
alpha dp is equal to minus
S beta dT plus V beta dp.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.100
So we're just applying the
fundamental relation to the

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.510
changes in each of the phases.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:05.580
But since the changes
in mu are equal,

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.230
so are these changes.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.130
And now I'm just going
to rearrange these.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:19.320
In other words, S beta minus S
alpha dT is equal to V theta

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.690
minus V alpha dp.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.120
And that immediately
is going to give us

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.580
our derivative dp/dT.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:56.740
So, dp/dT, staying the
coexistence curve, is just S

00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:04.960
beta minus S alpha over
V beta minus V alpha.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:13.190
Which is to say it's just, we
can say delta S over delta V.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:18.820
Going from alpha to beta.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.340
So we have a result that can
guide our thinking into what

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.060
the slopes of those
coexistence lines

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.960
are going to be.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.200
And it's pretty useful
to look at that.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.920
By the way, we can actually
express this in

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.490
another way if we want.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.930
And in some cases it can
be advantageous.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:46.710
And that is, we know that of
course G is H minus TS.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:55.685
So our mu alpha equals mu beta
condition, or a d mu alpha is

00:27:55.685 --> 00:28:00.310
d mu beta condition, can
be applied that way.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:07.200
That is, H alpha minus
TS alpha equals H

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.840
beta minus TS beta.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.780
So we can do the same
rearrangements.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:23.340
H beta minus H alpha equals
T S beta minus S alpha.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.980
And what that's saying, in other
words, is that we can

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:33.700
substitute for delta S, delta H
over T. So we can write our

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.810
relation for dp/dT
in two ways.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:45.070
We can also write dp/dT at
coexistence is equal to delta

00:28:45.070 --> 00:29:00.730
H over T delta V. Going
from alpha to beta.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:11.630
These are both forms of what's
called the Clapeyron equation.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:12.930
And these are always valid.

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.800
We haven't made any
approximations.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.370
Yet.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.380
Later, in going to the gas
phase, we'll make some

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.870
approximations about having
an ideal gas.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:25.220
We'll be able to treat this
delta V in a simple way using

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.370
the ideal gas law.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.500
But for now, these are exact.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.970
OK, so now let's look
at what it tells us.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:42.140
Let's look at the different
pieces of the phase diagram

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:56.660
and see what we can conclude.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.120
Essentially we should be able
to construct qualitatively,

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.520
the features of the phase
diagram using this relation.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.340
So let's try to do that.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.850
Here's p and T. We're going to
start with an empty slate.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:20.690
And now let's look at
the liquid gas case.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:25.800
So, let's look at our delta
S delta V, going

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.430
from liquid to gas.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:35.230
Well, one thing you know, when
you go from liquid to gas,

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:40.740
what happens to the
molar volume?

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.310
It increases.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.110
By a little, by a lot?

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:46.440
By a lot, right?

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.270
The molar volume in the gas is
enormous compared to the molar

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.560
volume in the liquid.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:56.890
So delta V is positive
and very big.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:01.160
Now let's think about delta S.
What's it going to do, going

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.610
from liquid to gas?

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:05.830
It's going to increase?

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.550
The disorder increases.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.390
Now, it increases
significantly.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.970
But the liquid already is
a disordered phase.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.510
And the molecules and the
liquid already have

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.200
considerable freedom.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.350
Certainly not near as much as
they have in the gas phase.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.800
But still considerable.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.910
So, to be sure, delta
S positive.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:28.180
And it's not small.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.520
So there's your condition.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.245
It's not nearly as big
as delta V is going

00:31:35.245 --> 00:31:37.300
to turn out to be.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.600
So what's going to happen here
is, if we look at the slope

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.430
going from liquid to
gas, it's positive.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.560
But it's not enormous.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.380
It's not very steep.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:32:02.490
So dp/dT, for liquid-gas
coexistence right, greater

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:07.420
than zero, but small.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:14.220
Not steep slope.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:19.970
So somewhere, we're going to
put our liquid-gas curve.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.400
And I, where exactly we
can worry about it.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.080
We haven't put any numbers
on this scale.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.200
But the point is, wherever it
is, it's not going to be a

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.430
very steep slope.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:35.180
How about solid to gas?

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:42.650
Well, so what's delta V going
from the solid to the gas?

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:49.960
What happens to the
molar volume?

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.100
What happens to the molar
volume, going from solid?

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.520
Of course, by a lot,
by a little?

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.030
By a lot.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:57.990
It's an enormous increase.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:01.010
Even bigger than before.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:06.420
How about delta S, the
entropy change?

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.290
Yeah, it increases.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.920
And also by a lot, because now
you're going from an ordered

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.650
crystalline solid, usually, so
you have a very, very, low

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.260
entropy there.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.440
Into a disordered phase.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.010
Not just the liquid,
but the gas phase.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:23.150
So this is also very big.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:28.170
Well, ok, so now we've got delta
S over delta V. There's

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.090
going to be a steeper slope.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:40.610
Because this is bigger then
for liquid to gas.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:46.330
So typically, the solid-liquid
part will have a steeper slope

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:55.550
then the liquid to gas part.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.760
Now, wait.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.850
Sorry, sorry, this
isn't right.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:06.710
And that's because I've really
badly misplaced things here.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:08.570
That was solid to gas that
we just discussed.

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:13.730
It has the steepest slope
relative to liquid-gas.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:23.840
OK, now let's think about
solid to liquid.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:30.670
Delta V for going from
solid to a liquid.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:31.670
What is it?

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.340
What sign is it?

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.200
How big is it?

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.590
Let's forgot about the
sign for a minute.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:41.180
How much does the volume, molar
volume, change going

00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:42.830
from solid to liquid?

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.290
Yeah, not a very lot, right?

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.220
You melt the solid.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:48.330
There's still a little piece
of stuff down there.

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.060
Didn't increase in volume
enormously.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.860
Usually, it increases.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:35:00.600
So generally delta V is
greater than, or sort

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.490
of equal to, zero.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:05.750
It's not a big amount.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:06.540
How about entropy?

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.400
Going from solid to liquid?

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.860
It increases, by
a good amount.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.690
You're going from an ordered
to a disordered phase.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:19.800
So delta S is greater
than zero.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.750
And so the result here is, now,
if you look at dS/dV, or

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.610
delta S over delta V, delta S
is positive and you a pretty

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:28.970
good amount.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.510
Delta V is small.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.690
The molar volume
hardly changed.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.665
And so what that's going to tell
us is the slope is going

00:35:35.665 --> 00:35:37.420
to be steep.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.400
And generally positive.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:47.620
So now, we're going to really
be on the increase.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.060
Typical kind of phase
diagram and

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:59.280
individual coexistence curve.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.100
And all these things, again, you
could understand in terms

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.360
of Le Chatelier's principle.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:09.530
In terms of going from, say,
solid to liquid if you know

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:15.330
think about two pressures.

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:18.980
Go from p1 to p2, some
higher pressure.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:19.760
Where are you?

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.910
Well, if you want to stay on the
coexistence curve you need

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:29.020
to raise the temperature quite
a bit in order to do that.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.700
Because, basically, to keep on
there, you know what's going

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.350
to happen if you have, say,
solid and liquid.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:37.570
It's ice and water.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:39.950
You know the freezing point,
it does depend on the

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:44.670
pressure, of course.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:49.320
But since the change in the
volume isn't that big, what

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:54.260
happens is, a modest change, if
you change the temperature

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.720
by a little bit, maybe easier
to think about it that way,

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.750
you've got to change the
pressure by a lot to stay on

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.830
the coexistence curve.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.550
Otherwise it'll have a great
tendency to simply go into one

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:10.100
phase or the other.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:14.190
Now we've, in a sense,
reconstructed the coexistence

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:21.220
curve by our consideration of
the Clapeyron equation.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.490
There's another way we can
usefully understand the

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:28.070
qualitative features of
the phase diagram.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.610
And that's just by looking
at mu itself.

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:33.750
Looking at the free energy
itself, at different

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.210
temperature.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.470
So let's just do that.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:49.390
Let's just consider mu of T
at some fixed pressure.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.230
Just qualitatively,
what will happen?

00:37:51.230 --> 00:38:02.110
So let's go back to d mu is
minus S dT plus V dp.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.030
And just look at the
derivatives.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:11.910
So d mu / dT at constant
pressure is minus s.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.380
Minus the molar volume.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.320
This is the one we're really
going to look at.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:21.000
Of course, we also could look
at d mu / dp at constant

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.870
temperature, and just
the molar volume.

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:29.700
Let's just look at this.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.840
We know that entropy is always
a positive number, right?

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.710
Entropy at the lowest, in a
perfect crystal, at zero

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:40.490
Kelvin, could be what value?

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.650
Entropy of a perfect
pure crystal at

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.920
zero degrees Kelvin.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.980
Zero, right?

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:49.090
And it's only going
up from there.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:59.370
So entropy is always positive.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:06.510
So what that tells us is that,
then, if we just look at mu

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:10.960
versus T, it's negative
S, for whatever phase.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:24.490
So it's always negative.

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.840
So in some sense, you say why?

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.950
Well, it's because we're keeping
pressure constant and

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:33.290
we're raising the temperature
and essentially the effect of

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:35.040
the entropy is more important.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.210
Is going up.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:41.490
You could see it just by saying
well, G is H minus TS.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:46.900
And as you raise temperature,
the product TS is increasing.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.980
Which means the G is
decreasing, because

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.230
it's H minus TS.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.340
So it's always a
negative slope.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.670
Let's look at it in the
different phases.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:00.470
So we have entropy of the gas,
that's greater than the

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.550
entropy of the liquid.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:05.930
Which is greater than the
entropy of the solid.

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:09.680
So that immediately tells us
the relative slopes for the

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.870
three phases.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:25.720
So d mu gas / dT at constant
pressure is minus S gas. d mu

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:42.720
liquid / dT is minus S of the
liquid. d mu solid / dT is

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.170
minus S of the solid.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:48.680
And the magnitude is much bigger
in the gas than the

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.590
liquid than the solid.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:54.500
And so the same goes
for the slope.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:41:10.880
So now let's sketch this.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.300
There's mu.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.890
And there's temperature.

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:18.380
So what we've seen is for the
gas, first of all, the slope's

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.000
always negative.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.590
And it's steepest by
far, or steepest

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:27.760
substantially, for the gas.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:35.590
Next steepest for the liquid.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:46.340
And least steep of all
for the solid.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.020
Now, there can be variation.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.635
Because, of course,
these do change as

00:41:49.635 --> 00:41:51.830
a function of pressure.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:55.060
But this, certainly the slope,
the magnitudes of the slopes

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.720
are always going to
be like this.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.600
What could change as a function
of pressure is where

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.340
these happen to lie.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.840
But this is certainly typical.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.000
So what does it mean?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.140
So, it means, remember, the
stuff is always going to be in

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:16.360
the phase with the lowest
value of mu.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:20.780
So at low temperature, down
here, that's where the solid

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:32.950
phase has the lowest
chemical potential.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.200
Now, let's keep going up.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.320
Eventually they cross.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.130
This is where, for this
particular pressure, this is

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:42.450
where the liquid and the solid
are in equilibrium.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.260
In other words, we've started,
we've got the solid and we're

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:44.910
raising the pressure.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:46.600
Now it's going to melt.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:51.930
Here's our melting point at
this particular pressure.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:54.750
And now we've got, if we keep
raising the temperature, we're

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:58.520
no longer in equilibrium, and
we'll be in the one phase part

00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.430
of the phase diagram.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:04.530
It's just the liquid.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:07.950
Because that's the lowest
chemical potential.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.930
Let's keep raising
the temperature.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.140
Down here, of course, the
chemical potential of the gas

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.710
is way up there, right?

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:17.350
So it's not going to come into
play now, though they're going

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:18.750
to be in equilibrium.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:24.400
Here is the boiling point.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.250
So now let's keep raising
the temperature.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:34.210
And we'll be in just the
gas part of the curve.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:40.440
And of course that'll
go on forever.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.520
So that can just help us
understand, in addition to the

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.955
slopes, the positions, the
relative positions, of where

00:43:47.955 --> 00:43:50.710
these equilibria occur.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:54.710
Now if we start changing the
pressure in particular, we

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.890
could move this.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:58.230
So that you could have a
sublimation point where the

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:00.790
gas and the solid are in
equilibrium because this has

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:06.930
moved over to here.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:10.600
Any questions about the overall
structure of the phase

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.400
diagrams and these
phase equilibria?

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:20.230
OK, let me just end with a few
comments about one part of the

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:26.370
phase diagram that we haven't
talked about yet.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:27.580
This.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:31.250
What's going on there?

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.560
If we were to change, of course,
I've got a finite

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.030
amount of space on the
blackboard, so I haven't drawn

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.700
T and p out to infinity.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:46.190
But if I could, this line would
keep going forever.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.900
There would always be some
pressure and temperature at

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.830
which you would have equilibrium
between two

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:54.790
different, distinct solid
and liquid phases.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:59.230
Turns out, that's not true for
the gas and the liquid.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.740
And there are a bunch
of ways to see this.

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.100
But one is you could think of
the symmetry difference.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:08.320
When you go from a crystal, a
crystal and solid, to a liquid

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.270
or a gas, there's no question
that you've changed phase.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:14.150
Because there's a symmetry in
the solid that's no longer

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:18.080
maintained in the isotropic
liquid or gas.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.690
So clearly there's never going
to be a point where these two

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.470
phases become the same thing.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:25.860
Become somehow
indistinguishable.

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.430
But the gas and the liquid,
I don't know, what's the

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:30.260
difference between them?

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.930
The density, right?

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:33.200
The gas is more dense.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.930
It's condensed.

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:36.370
Sorry, the liquid
is condensed.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:39.570
The gas isn't.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:44.400
But that starts to change when
you adjust the pressure and

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.690
temperature accordingly.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:48.930
And you can sort of
see it coming.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:54.120
What'll happen is, you change
the temperature, the molar

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.430
volumes of the liquid and
the gas start to get

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.290
equal to each other.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.730
That's what'll end
up happening.

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:05.080
And at that point, what's the
difference between them?

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.230
There is no difference.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.840
There's no symmetry
difference.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.380
So you can actually, instead
of going through a phase

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.220
transition, where there's a
meniscus, you can see the top

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.460
of the liquid when
you heat it up.

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.650
There's boiling and then
there's the gas.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.630
You can actually go from the
gas, let's go the other way,

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:28.400
from the liquid to the gas
phase, without ever boiling.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.790
If you change the pressure
as well.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:33.470
So that you can actually walk
all the way around the

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:34.530
critical point.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.450
What happens, is up here you
don't have two distinguishable

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:39.540
phases any more.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:44.510
And actually, material out at
this region has a bunch of

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:45.980
very unusual behaviors.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.400
Very useful behaviors,
actually.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.390
Chemical behavior can be really
very, very, different

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:52.100
in what's called supercritical,
the

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:56.470
supercritical region beyond
the critical point.

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:58.670
Water behaves really
unusually there.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:02.440
Or it turns out, in that region,
it turns out to be a

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.620
terrific solvent for
organic stuff.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.490
Organic molecules which
normally don't

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:09.690
dissolve well in water.

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.440
And it doesn't dissolve
salts very well.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.630
That's pretty unusual.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:20.100
Carbon dioxide, CO2, turns out
to be a pretty good solvent

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.290
for organics in the
supercritical region.

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:25.720
That's what dry cleaning is.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.940
Very nice, because know CO2,
apart from its slow effect on

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:32.730
our atmosphere, it's
not poisonous.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:33.650
It's not toxic.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:38.880
So you can do dry cleaning
without organic solvents.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.520
All sorts of unusual behavior
happens above

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.200
the critical point.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.070
Beyond the critical point.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:48.900
There's also a whole range
of behavior at

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:49.830
the critical point.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:53.490
Right at the critical point
that's extremely unusual.

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:56.535
That you could think of as a
consequence of the fact that

00:47:56.535 --> 00:47:58.600
the molar volumes are
getting to be almost

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.980
equal to each other.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.420
That's unusual in
a lot of ways.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.950
And what ends up happening is,
you can see if you go online,

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:11.040
actually, if you just Google
critical point, you can see

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.730
amazing movies of stuff that's
at the critical point.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.230
Because what happens is, so
you've got the liquid.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:18.290
And you've got a meniscus,
and you've got the gas.

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.990
And you can tell.

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.700
You look at it.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.430
There's the liquid.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.070
There's the gas.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:26.200
But if you go real close to the
critical point, the stuff

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.990
doesn't really know what
phase it's in.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:29.640
Because it's losing
the distinction

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.840
between the two phases.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.750
You start seeing globules
of liquid up

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:34.970
there in the gas phase.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:37.690
And globules of the gas
down in the liquid.

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:39.960
Because their densities - I
mean, the only reason the

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.580
liquid's at the bottom normally
is because the

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.500
density is higher.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:48.430
If that stops being the case, it
has no more right to occupy

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:51.050
the bottom part than the gas.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:54.580
And so they sort of start
interchanging.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.200
And if you get even closer,
of course, what eventually

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.190
happens is, there's
just one phase.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:02.450
You don't see distinct
meniscus's any more.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:08.460
But right near there, you see
enormous fluctuations in the

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.780
local density and
in the location.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.870
The physical locations
of different phases.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:17.510
And we'll see that come in
another context later.

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:20.520
Because when we talk about two
phase equilibria solutions.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.330
You get this with you oil and
water, you get critical

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:27.970
mixtures also, where right
at the special point, the

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.650
meniscus goes away and the oil
and water start interchanging.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:36.210
And in those situations, a tiny
amount of force can give

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:38.480
you a really big response.

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.650
Because the two things are just
teetering in the balance.

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:43.620
So a little bit of force
pushes things

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:45.140
one way or the other.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.000
That's actually useful
in a whole bunch

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:47.820
of different cases.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:51.770
Because that critical behavior
happens in all kinds of phase

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:52.470
transitions.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:54.570
Magnetic phase transitions.

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:55.960
Ferroelectric phase
transitions.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.430
And in those situations, a tiny
little magnetic field,

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.170
for example, gives you a really
big change in the

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:02.930
magnetization.

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:05.440
If the alignment of spins.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.460
And that's very useful.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.000
You can get a very big material
response and change.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.630
You can switch something, for
example, with a really small

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:14.690
external field.

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:18.060
And in these cases, you can
change the density really a

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.990
lot by only a small change
in pressure.

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:26.040
OK, next time we'll extend the
Clapeyron equation and also go

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.800
to two component systems.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.840
So you actually, Professor
Blendi will take

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.260
over again on Friday.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.100
And we'll see you then.
