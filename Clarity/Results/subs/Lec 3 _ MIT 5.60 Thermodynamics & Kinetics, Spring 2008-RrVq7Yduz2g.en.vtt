00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.120
PROFESSOR: As you can probably
tell from the volume of my

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.110
voice, I'm not Moungi.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.790
I'm Bob Field, and I will be
lecturing today as a special

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.640
booby prize, because Bawendi
is so wonderful.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.460
Last time you heard about
work and heat.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.760
So there's p v work and it's
given by the integral minus p

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.020
external dv or just
the integral from

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.560
one to two of dw.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.040
And this little slash here
means an in inexact

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.030
differential.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.220
The reason for inexact doesn't
mean it's a crummy

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.150
measurement, it means that it's
path dependent, and so

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.730
the value of this integral
depends on how you get from

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:26.070
one to two. w greater than zero
means that work is done

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.870
on the system, and it's really
important to keep track of the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.550
signs of these things.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:40.870
For heat, heat is defined, or
the energy unit for heat,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.710
calorie, is defined as the
amount of heat needed to raise

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:53.030
one gram of water from 14.5
degrees c to 15.5 degrees c.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.800
That great deal of specificity
implies that heat is also

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.070
path-dependent and again we have
the convention that if

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.580
heat is added to the system,
the quantity is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.410
greater than zero.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.470
OK, so that's a quick
statement of what

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.020
happened last time.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.960
Today we're going to talk
about heat capacity.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:37.490
The first law, a process that
takes a gas from p1, V1, T to

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:47.790
p2, V2, T examined for
various paths.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.410
And what you'll find is that the
maximum work out is obtain

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.130
for a reversible path.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.790
We'll then look at the quantity,
internal energy,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.990
which we define through the
first law, and we think of it

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.460
as a function of two variables
T and V. And whenever we say

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.450
something like that, we'll be
able to write a differential,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.500
the partial of u, with respect
to T at constant V, dT, plus

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.900
the partial of u with respect
to V at constant T dV.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.460
So, if we write something
like this, it implies

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.950
this kind of equation.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.380
And the main points of the
latter part of the lecture is

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.780
what are these quantities?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.810
How do we measure them?

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.430
How do we understand them?

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.370
This one turns out to be the
heat capacity, and this one

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.540
turns out to be something
that we measure in

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.490
the Joule-free expansion.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.750
So, that's the menu for today,
at least that's what Moungi

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:10.540
assigned me to cover, and
I'll do the best I can.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:18.420
So, let's talk about
heat capacity.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.200
Heat capacity relates the amount
of heat that you add to

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.270
the system to the change in
temperature, and this is the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.380
relationship.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.370
The heat-added, temperature,
and this is a

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.350
proportionality constant.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.570
Heat capacity depends on path.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:51.140
So, here are two kinds
of experiments.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:59.020
Here we have a fixed volume, and
we have a little candle,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.520
and we're adding heat, and
when we add heat, the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.520
pressure does what?

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.190
STUDENT:

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.650
PROFESSOR: It increases
and the temperature.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.450
OK, we're you know,
this is MIT.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.720
You guys know something.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.430
You should yell it out,
not just whisper it.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.495
You have the confidence --

00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:29.910
I mean maybe up the street we
whisper, but here we know it.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:37.250
And, so here is a different kind
of system where we have a

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.040
constant external pressure.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.290
We add heat to the system.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.590
And so here the volume
can change.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.310
The temperature can change.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.040
And so as we add heat here, the
temperature goes up and

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.240
the volume -- that was even
quieter than last time.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.580
OK, but you know it.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.430
You understand it.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.720
Now, the coefficient that
relates the amount of heat in

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.240
to the temperature change
is obviously going to be

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.130
different for these two cases.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.140
in this case, where we have a
fixed volume, we say dq is

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.230
equal that Cv, heat capacity
dT, where the v specifies

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.340
what's constant for the path.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.400
And so this is one path,
constant volume.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.350
This has a particular value.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:44.930
Over here, we have dq=Cp dT, the
heat, the proportionality

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.160
between heat and temperature
rise is given by this, the

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.820
constant pressure
heat capacity.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.480
They're different quantities.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.890
If we want to know the total
heat added to the system, we

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.670
can measure it, which is the
straightforward thing, but

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.720
sometimes you want to calculate
in advance, or

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.050
sometimes you want to calculate
it on an exam.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.000
So, we do an integral over a
path, for the heat capacity

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.330
along that path, dT.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.490
So, for Cp and Cv, these are
often quantities that are

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.945
measured as a function of
temperature, and one could, in

00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:28.720
fact, calculate this integral.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.130
For most problems on exams,
those quantities are constant,

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.590
independent of temperature.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:41.890
But there's no guarantee
that they will be.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.250
Now I get to tell a fun story.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.400
The relationship between heat
and work was initially

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.380
proposed in the 1940's
by Joule.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.780
Now, there are two stories about
Joule and how he came to

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.270
this insight.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.240
One is that he observed when
people were machining cannon

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.530
barrels, a lot of heat was
generated, and there was a lot

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.990
of work done.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.840
And so maybe the work
generated the heat.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.680
Or there was a relationship
between work and heat.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.070
Well, this is ridiculous because
people were making

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.500
cannons long before 1840.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.630
The other story, which is
probably just as untrue, is

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:37.580
that Joule, on his honeymoon,
took his wife to a mountain

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:44.100
resort, and they were sitting at
the bottom of a waterfall,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.400
and he had this wonderful
idea.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.405
And that was the water at the
bottom of the waterfall is

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:54.160
probably going to be hotter than
the water at the top of

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.510
the waterfall.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.900
So he grabbed his thermometer,
and went and made a couple of

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.990
measurements and discovered
the first law of

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.510
thermodynamics.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.360
In fact, the water at the bottom
of the waterfall is

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.980
hotter than the water at the
top of the waterfall.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.730
And the idea was that gravity
did work on the water and

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:23.780
falling, and that work led to
the generation of heat.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.140
If you think about this, you
probably can come up with

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.190
several other ideas for how the
water at the bottom might

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.130
be warmer than at the top.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.170
I mean it's flowing fast at
the top, and it's sort of

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.010
pooled at the bottom, and there
is sunlight and all

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:43.170
sorts of things that could
make this coincidental as

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.160
opposed to an insightful
observation.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.120
But it's a good story,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.600
Joule decided that there must
be a direct relationship

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.830
between work and heat.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.340
They are the same quantity.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.270
They are both forms of energy.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.700
And so, we have this cartoon.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.900
Again, we have an open beaker
and a candle, and we're

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:15.040
putting only heat into this
beaker, and the temperature

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.900
goes from T1 to T2.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:25.180
And delta T is given by the
heat, which has to do with how

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.850
much of the candle burnt,
divided by the constant

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.650
pressure heat capacity.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.480
Now you could do a similar sort
of thing, but instead of

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.380
having a candle, you have a
paddle wheel, and the paddle

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.700
wheel is spun by a weight
that's dropping

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.710
from here to here.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.820
So, this weight is being
spun-- now I'm really

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.450
fantastic at drawing this
mechanical device, but you can

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.120
imagine that dropping
a weight can cause a

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.150
paddle wheel to turn.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:04.650
And we know about gravity,
and we know about work.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:14.400
So, if you're doing physics,
work is the integral of force,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.260
dx, x1 to x2.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.110
Right, that's work.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:24.630
Now, gravity, well force,
is equal to mass times

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.810
acceleration, and the
acceleration due

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.530
to gravity is g.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:34.590
The force, as this weight drops
is constant, and so the

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:41.500
work is just going to be
m g h, where this is h.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.290
So, it's a trivial matter, by
looking at what is the weight,

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.350
and how far does it drop, to say
OK, how much work is done

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.370
by the paddle wheel.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:57.140
And this is in an isolated,
in an adiabatic container.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.780
All the energy that is inserted
into this, which

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:08.770
might be turbulence initially,
becomes heat, or becomes -- it

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.250
raises the temperature.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:16.620
And so, again, we see a
temperature increase, and we

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:22.560
know the work, and the
temperature increase, it's a

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.980
constant pressure thing.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.230
And so we now have
two observations.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.730
The same temperature increase,
work and heat, and we have a

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.210
relationship between
heat and work.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:42.780
The first law of thermodynamics
is --

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.310
I'm fine.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.070
I don't --

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.230
I'm all set, I only
use this chalk.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:56.450
I brought it with me.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.470
The first law of thermodynamics,
written

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:06.480
concisely is dw plus dq, two
inexact differentials,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.870
integrated over any closed
path, is zero.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:18.860
This is an abstract and
powerful mathematical

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.310
statement of the first law
of thermodynamics.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:27.770
There are much better or more
appealing expressions.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:34.070
One is, du, u is called the
internal energy or just the

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:42.210
energy, is equal
to dq plus dw.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.520
OK, notice we have two inexact
differentials and exact

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.040
differentials.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.450
This is a condition.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.540
If you have a quantity which
is constant over any closed

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.730
path, that quantity is a
thermodynamics state function.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.830
So, this observation is
equivalent to saying that

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:09.150
there must be something that
is path independent.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.880
Therefore, we don't have
a cross through the d.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.490
And the first law says, well
heat and work are different

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.890
forms of energy, and we can
add them, and the path

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.720
dependence of these two things
is somehow cancelled in the

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.100
fact that we have this
internal energy.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:38.040
So, we can also write delta u as
integral from 1 to 2 of du.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:46.390
That's u2 minus u1,
and it's q plus w.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.440
So, these two quantities, again,
are path dependent.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.050
This is not.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.000
That's the first law
of thermodynamics.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.130
It seems trivial, but it's
really important.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.850
It's almost as important
as the second law of

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:07.980
thermodynamics, which you'll
see in a week or so.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.430
There is a corollary to this.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:15.860
If we say we have a system, and
it's in its surroundings.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:23.090
We can talk about du for the
system well, that's q plus w.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.650
And we can say du for
the surroundings.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.730
Well the system got its work
from the surroundings.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.990
It either had work, got its heat
from the surroundings, or

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.210
it got worked on by
the surroundings.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:45.910
And so, we can immediately write
this and then we can

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:51.790
write du for the universe,
which is system plus

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.820
surroundings is equal to zero.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.000
This is the corollary.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.150
It's due to Clausius and it
says the energy in the

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.030
universe is conserved.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:05.820
Fairly powerful statement, and
that's another form of the

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.880
first law of thermodynamics.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.180
OK, enough for really
great discoveries.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:18.340
Now let's talk about some
simple observations on

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:30.860
isothermal gas expansions.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:36.140
The purpose here is to look at a
series of processes in which

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.750
temperature is held constant,
and we're going to calculate

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:45.030
how much work we get from
allowing a gas to expand under

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.990
various conditions.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:52.390
And what we'll discover is that
when we allow the gas to

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:58.010
expand reversibly, we
get the most work.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.110
This is neat.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.620
This is important.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.850
OK, so we have constant
temperature, because it's

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:07.970
isothermal.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.320
And let's do a series
of experiments.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:18.960
First let's set the external
pressure equal to zero.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.000
So we have an experiment
that looks like this.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.830
We have a piston.

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.200
We have a pair of stops.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.580
We have another pair of stops.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:40.500
We start at p1, V1. and p
external is equal to zero.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.600
In other words, this
is vacuum.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:50.990
And so what happens when we
remove these stops is that the

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.900
piston slams up against the
next pair of stops.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.480
It goes very fast.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.300
You could calculate the time.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.390
You could do all sorts of stuff,
but what is important

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:11.140
is that this piston in moving
from here to here did no work

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:17.095
on the surroundings because
work is the integral of

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:21.000
pressure dv, and the pressure
external is zero.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.560
It doesn't matter what the
pressure internal is.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.120
This is a point that is often
confusing, because you can

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.960
think, well maybe I could
calculate what the internal

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.390
pressure is even for this
very rapid process.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.510
It doesn't matter.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.850
Thermodynamics is asking you,
what work does this thing do

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.840
on the surroundings or the
surroundings do on the system?

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.530
And there is no work done on
the surroundings because

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.340
pressure is zero.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:59.760
So, the work for this process is
the integral, or minus the

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:08.390
integral, V1, V2, p dV.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.470
And it's p external and
p external is zero,

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.550
so there's no work.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:23.510
OK, the next example is, well,
when this piston slams up

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:31.030
against these stops, the gas
has expanded -- we're doing

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:36.830
this isothermally, so this is in
contact with the heat bath.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.430
The gas has expanded.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.900
It has a particular pressure
and a particular volume.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.450
Every time you do the experiment
in equilibrium with

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:53.300
the heat bath at T, you'll
get the same p2 and V2.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.470
One can know them.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.980
And so we can then say, OK,
let's do this second

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:10.860
expansion. and let's set
p external equal to p2.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.730
And we do the same
sort of thing.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.970
We have stops here.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.430
We have p1, V1.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.790
And we don't really need
stops up here.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:31.620
We have a weight on the piston,
and that weight is

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.150
chosen so that it
acts as though p

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:40.000
external is equal to p2.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.840
We know the pressure is equal
to force per area.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.520
And so we know the force for a
particular mass, and we know

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.750
the area of the piston. so we
know how to do this, and we

00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:00.290
know this thing when it hit
these stops, the pressure with

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.720
p2, and the volume was V2.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.110
Now we could put stops here at
V2, but this piston would just

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.890
kiss the stops.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:13.690
It would stop there because
we've chosen p2.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:23.370
The work for that process is
going to be minus V1, V2, p2,

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.930
because that's what we chose p
external to be, dV, and that's

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:34.630
going to be minus
p2, V2 minus V1.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.740
That's the work.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.710
V2 is larger than V1, and
so this quantity here is

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.820
positive, and we have a negative
sign because the

00:21:42.820 --> 00:22:14.290
system did work.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:20.230
OK, so now we can take the
result from this and put it

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:31.940
onto a p v diagram. p1, p2,
V1, V2 -- so here is the

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.830
initial situation, and here
is the final situation.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:42.040
And the equation of state,
pressure versus volume at

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.080
constant temperature, is going
to have some form, let's just

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.200
draw it in there like that.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.930
So that's an equation
of state.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.740
It's like the ideal gas
law, and one could

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.610
know that in principle.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:23:04.390
OK, so we did work -- oh, I
should mention p times V has

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:11.110
units of energy or
units of work.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.750
Remember that, because you're
going to find lots of

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.630
thermodynamics quantities, and
you're often going to be

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.150
writing on exams, deriving
things on exams, and you're

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.850
going to almost always want the
combinations of quantities

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.470
to have units of energy.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.660
So, dimensional analysis is
extremely valuable in

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.010
thermodynamics, and here
is an example of it.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:40.400
Anyway, the work associated
with process number two is

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.320
described by this box.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.980
Because we did work at constant
pressure, and so it's

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.530
just volume difference
times pressure.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:24:00.860
OK, now we can do the process
in two steps.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.780
So we start out with
our piston.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.980
We have two weights on it.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:15.100
So we have p1, V1.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.020
We have stops.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:21.800
We've chosen two weights,
so that this is p3.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.930
External pressure is p3.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:31.200
It's higher than p2.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:41.920
So we remove the stops, and the
piston moves up, and now

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.490
we remove one of these weights.
and when we remove

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:51.130
one of the weights, this gives
an external pressure p2.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:56.110
So, the piston moves up
again, one weight.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.810
So here is p2, p external.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.760
Here is p3.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.710
And so we have the work
coming from two steps.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:11.400
And it's trivial to calculate
what that will be, and when

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:21.940
you do that, if we put p3 in on
this diagram, what you end

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:27.910
up finding is that you get an
initial little bit of work

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:32.380
corresponding to V3.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:38.560
So we break up our work into
three pieces, and we

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:52.450
get more work out.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:26:06.610
So the final process involves
do it reversibly, or almost

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.000
reversibly.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.050
We want p equal to p external
for the entire expansion, and

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:19.800
p external is decreased steadily
from p1 to p2.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.550
How do we do this?

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:29.730
Well, we start out with our
usual system, and we have a

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.170
bunch of little pebbles on it.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:38.350
Each weighing, say, one 100th
of the weight needed to

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:43.210
establish p external
is equal to p1.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.120
We remove a pebble,
system expands.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.040
We remove another one,
system expands.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.990
That's equivalent to doing the
integral, and so, what we end

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:59.520
up getting is that the
reversible work is equal to

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:06.850
minus integral V1, V2, p dV.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:11.430
Because what we've done is we
forced p, pressure here, to be

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.550
equal to the external
pressure.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:19.120
We've changed the external
pressure slowly, and again

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.160
this is isothermal.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.260
There is a heat bath
here that keeps

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.160
the temperature constant.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.830
So, the system does work on the
surroundings, hence the

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.010
minus sign.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:37.130
Now, if this is an ideal gas, we
know that pressure is equal

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.380
to nRT over volume.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.510
So we can put that in here
and do this integral.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:52.720
We have minus V1, V2,
nRT over V dV.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.080
These are all constant.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.100
It's isothermal.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.060
We can take them out.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.570
It's a closed system, so the
number moles doesn't change.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.360
The ideal gas constant doesn't
change, temperature doesn't

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:09.910
change, and so we just have
minus nRT integral V1, V2, dV

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:17.710
over V. Now, we are very gentle
in this course with

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.830
respect to knowing integrals,
but this is

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.720
one you have to know.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:31.600
The integral of one over a
quantity is the natural log.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:41.340
And so we can write this, minus
nRT log V2 over V1.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.490
That should not take a breath.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:47.330
You know that much
about integrals.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:56.110
OK, now we actually would like
to simplify this or to write

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.190
this in terms of not the
volume change, but the

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.840
pressure change.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.540
So, we have V2 over V1.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:10.450
Well, what we can write that
using the ideal gas law twice,

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:14.580
V2 is equal -- pV = nRT.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:23.170
So V2 = (nRT)/p2, and
V1 = (nRT)/p1.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:34.060
So, the nRT's cancel, and
we have p1 over p2.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:42.690
And so, we can rewrite this as
the work is equal to minus nRT

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:53.880
log p1 over p2, or nRT
log p2 over p1.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:30:00.990
Now, p2 is less than p1, so this
is a negative quantity.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:07.770
The system has done work.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:15.880
So the reversible process, we
had this curve, and for the

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:23.000
irreversible processes, we got
this, and then this, whoops,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.620
and now we get the
whole thing.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:31.740
So for the reversible process,
the work done is the integral

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.090
under the pressure volume
state function,

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:39.630
the function of state.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:49.480
OK, what time is it?

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.680
I'm going to actually get caught
up, make up for but

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.350
Bawendi's slow lecturing.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.060
That doesn't mean it's better,
it just means that I'm making

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.330
up for a problem that
he created.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:06.670
OK, so what do we know so far?

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:20.680
Maximum work out is by
reversible path.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:27.110
Delta u is q plus w.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:35.960
So the maximum work out required
the maximum heat in.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:42.820
So a reversible process leads
to requiring certain

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:49.140
quantities to be maximized.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:54.210
Now, we have u, q and w.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.710
We have a relationship
between them.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:05.550
Often, for a particular state
change, it is easy to

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:10.010
calculate two of these,
but not the third.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:13.500
And because there is an explicit
relationship between

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:21.650
u, delta u, q and w, you can
always find the easy way to

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:25.960
derive the change in
internal energy or

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.750
the heat or the work.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.420
Even if the thing that you
really want is an integral

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:40.590
that would be difficult
to evaluate.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:51.870
OK, now, we're going to look
at the internal energy, and

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:56.720
we're going to pretend that it
is explicitly a function of

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.080
temperature and volume.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.650
We could choose any two
quantities, and, in fact, it

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.920
turns out that these are going
to prove, after we have the

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.090
second law, not to be
the best choice.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:16.120
But it's allowed to say the
internal energy is a function

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.420
of temperature and volume.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:25.240
When you say that, it implies
that the differential is given

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.990
by this pair of partial
derivatives.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:35.530
V dT, partial of u with respect
to the volume holding

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.850
temperature constant, dV.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:42.190
So if you say this, it requires
you to say this.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.440
Now, the purpose of this
exercise is to give you a

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.530
little bit of practice in
figuring out what these

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:49.270
quantities are.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:52.360
And do a little practice
in manipulating these

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:57.490
differentials.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:03.800
So, we have, we're interested
in the change in internal

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:10.660
energy for various experimental
constraints.

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:16.300
And so, one constraint is the
process be done reversibly.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:25.270
Well then, du is equal to dq
reversible plus dw reversible,

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:37.230
which is minus p dV, because p
is equal to p external for a

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:43.600
reversible process, and
we can write that.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.430
We could have isolated.

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:52.290
Suppose we're looking at the
system isolated from the

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.650
outside world.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:35:00.830
Well, dq is equal to zero and
dw is equal to zero because

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.230
it's isolated.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:21.590
So that implies du
is equal to zero.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:29.650
We could do an adiabatic
process.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:34.690
Adiabatic means there's no heat
transferred in or out of

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.020
the system.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:41.780
We don't say anything about
whether the system does work

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:47.760
or has worked on -- implicitly
here, we're talking about a

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.900
closed system, so there's no
mass leaving the system.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:58.230
But if it's adiabatic, then dq
is equal zero, and for an

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:11.580
adiabatic process, then
du is equal to dw.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:17.880
OK, now this is a point
we want to be careful.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:25.320
Be careful.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.510
Suppose we are doing an
adiabatic process.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:38.000
We can do it reversibly, or
we can do it irreversibly.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.140
So suppose we do it
irreversibly.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:46.580
Suppose we just remove stops,
and the system slams up

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.080
against the other stops.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.310
Did no work.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:56.030
Does that mean du is zero?

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:59.990
You bet it does not.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:06.450
So, it's important to write this
little thing on here, du

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:10.750
is equal to the reversible
work, not just the work.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:14.760
You can have a process where
you can measure an

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.710
irreversible process,
where you could

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.890
calculate the work done.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:19.130
It could be zero.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.430
It could be something else.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:27.210
But if it's not reversible,
it's not du.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.840
And you will be invited to
make that mistake on

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.280
an exam, I'm sure.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:41.140
OK, so, the thing about a state
function is that the

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:46.200
function has a value for initial
conditions and at

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.580
final conditions.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.550
And the difference
between those is

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.980
what you could measure.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:59.020
If you measure something
else, you won't get du.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.340
Be careful, and this is going
to be especially complicated

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:07.590
and confusing when we get to
quantities that have a more

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:11.980
obscure meaning like entropy.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.820
I mean we can, we can sort of
understand why OK, the total

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.030
energy, if we measure it, we
measure a process which is not

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.940
reversible.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:26.430
Well it might not give the
energy change for that

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:31.070
process, but when we have
a quantity which is more

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:36.620
obscure, which the definition
of that quantity requires a

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:40.700
very specific prescription for
calculating, you're going to

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.680
get into trouble.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:47.460
So exam this and be sure
you understand that.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:53.410
OK, constant volume.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.500
Well for constant volume,
dw is equal to zero.

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.320
Why?

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.270
How does it do, what is work?

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.640
Well it's p v work if the
volume doesn't change.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.610
There is no work.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:13.150
So in this case du is equal to
dq, and we put a little v on

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:22.820
it to imply the work, the change
in internal energy is

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:28.410
equal to the heat added
at constant volume.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.060
Nothing reversible about it.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.460
It's now, all we have to do is
say we're going to have heat

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.280
at constant volume.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.330
OK, and now we return to
this differential.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:45.320
We want to ask the question,
what are these two quantities?

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.310
How do we know what they are?

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:54.090
This should be particularly
bothersome to you because, as

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:58.070
you've already experienced in
5.60, there are a lot of

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.750
partial derivatives. there
are a lot of variables.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.610
There are a lot of things
held constant.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:07.290
It's easy to get lost in this
sea of quantities, none of

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:08.840
which have obvious meaning.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:13.240
So now what we're going to do is
start to extract what these

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.840
things mean.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:22.570
OK, so for a constant volume
process, we can write du,

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.990
partial derivative of u with
respect to T at constant V,

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:34.210
dT, plus partial derivative
of u at constant V, dV.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.950
OK, for constant volume,
this is zero.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:47.300
So this term is gone, and we
rewrite this du, V is equal to

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:56.000
du/dT, at constant V, dT v.
So we, have a change in

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.350
temperature done at constant
volume, and we have a change

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.930
in internal energy done at
constant volume, and we

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.690
rearrange this.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:18.930
And we discover that du/dT at
constant V is equal to du/dT

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:24.780
at constant V. What, have
I done something silly?

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:37.390
Oh well, yes I have. dq v, so
du v is equal to dq v and so

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:41.740
what I should have written here,
this is true, we can get

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:46.910
a partial derivative by taking
two total derivatives at the

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:50.070
same pressure, at the same
quantity, but what I really

00:41:50.070 --> 00:42:11.140
wanted to do is to write dq
v is equal to the partial

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:21.670
derivative of T, constant v dT
v. OK, and now, we know the

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:29.550
relationship between heat and a
temperature change is given

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:35.700
by a quantity, a heat capacity
for a particular path, and

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:36.370
here it is.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:43.020
So what we've discovered from
this relationship that du at

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:49.920
constant volume is equal to dq
v. We have discovered that

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.860
this partial derivative that
appears in the definition, the

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.730
abstract definition of the
differential for internal

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:04.140
energy, is just equal to the
constant volume heat capacity.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:10.200
So, in this definition now, we
have one term which we know.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.950
It's something that
we can measure.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:17.030
We can measure the heat capacity
at constant volume,

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:22.160
and now we have another term,
and if we can figure out how

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.000
to measure it, we'll have
a complete form for this

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.770
differential which
will enable us to

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:36.720
calculate du for any process.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:48.600
So let me write where I am
now, or we are now. du is

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:56.620
equal to Cv dT, plus partial of
u with respect to volume at

00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:00.050
constant temperature dV.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:04.490
So, we've simplified the
expression by replacing one of

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:08.550
the partial derivatives by a
quantity that we can measure.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:12.570
And we like to know
what about this.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.360
So we need an experiment
that will enable us to

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.910
measure this quantity.

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:23.940
And that's where we get Joule,
and I like to say it Joule's

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:30.300
free expansion -- it's usually
referred to as the Joule free

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:35.160
expansion, which sort of implies
that no energy flows,

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:39.430
which actually is true, but it's
an experiment proposed by

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:45.370
Joule, and the experiment
involves an adiabatic box.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:51.770
So we have system insulated from
the outside world, and we

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:57.360
have two bulbs.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.840
There's a valve between them.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:05.700
And so we have gas and
we have vacuum.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:11.020
So the Joule free expansion
involves opening this valve

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:17.510
and asking what happens when
this gas moves into the other

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:21.830
bulb or distributes between the
two. well since the gas is

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:25.680
expanding into vacuum
no work is done.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.120
Since it's isolated,
no heat is added.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:39.270
So du is equal to zero because
dq and dw are both zero.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:44.550
So we can now take this
expression and rewrite it

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:48.100
under the condition of
du is equal to zero.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:53.030
So we have du equal to zero,
just a zero here.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:46:00.910
Cv dT constant u plus the
derivative du/dV at constant

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:06.720
T, dV at constant u.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.730
This is just a number.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:12.880
We don't have to specify that
it's measured at constant u.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.110
It's just a number.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:18.880
So now we rearrange this
expression, and so we get

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:34.700
du/dV at constant T is equal to
minus Cv times dT u over dV

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:41.630
u or minus Cv partial derivative
of temperature with

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:50.710
respect for volume a constant,
free energy, a constant

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:52.630
internal energy.

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:57.890
So, this is the quantity
we want.

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:03.390
It's related to the heat
capacity, the constant volume

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:07.300
of heat capacity and something
you could measure.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:11.780
What happens as you expand
into volume?

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.160
Does the temperature go up?

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.780
Does it not change?

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:21.770
Joule actually did this
experiment, and he observed

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:27.180
that for the gas expansions
that he could do, that the

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:32.570
temperature did not increase
measurably.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:41.330
So he made an incorrect
conclusion.

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:44.720
Because something was small
and unmeasurable, he said,

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:53.280
well the best of my knowledge
dT/dV at constant

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.560
u is equal to zero.

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:06.380
And that implies that since the
quantity we want is given

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.620
by this quantity, which is zero
times a constant, the

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:13.290
quantity we want is also zero.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:20.800
So it would imply that du
was equal to only the

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.250
first term Cv dT.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.200
Now, this is an important
lesson in

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.380
what you do in science.

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.560
You make an observation.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.080
You make an observation doing
an experiment that is as

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.370
accurate as you can do.

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:42.600
And so an experiment said the
gas didn't increase its

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.910
temperature when it expanded
the vacuum.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:50.050
And so the next thing you do is
you call up a journal and

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:55.270
say I've discovered a
fundamental law of nature.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:49:03.820
And, so you propose that there
is no, that this derivative is

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.840
zero, and that the internal
energy is given

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.860
simply by this quantity.

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:14.490
It turns out that this quantity
here, which is called

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:19.430
eta of J the Joule free
expansion parameter, is not

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:21.170
quite zero.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:25.870
When you expand a real
gas into vacuum, the

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:29.130
temperature goes down.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:39.715
So this is a very small number
and for ideal gases, eta J is

00:49:39.715 --> 00:49:41.050
equal to zero.

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:46.220
This quantity is exactly zero
for an ideal gas and we'll

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:49.820
discover why eventually it has
to do with what we mean by an

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.690
ideal gas it turns out.

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:56.290
And so for many, many problems,
especially on exams,

00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:02.420
especially on this first exam,
you will be able to say that

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.780
this is the relationship between
internal energy and

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.080
temperature.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:12.110
That u is a function of
temperature only.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:15.630
It doesn't matter what
other things change.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:19.210
The value of the internal energy
is only determined by

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:20.020
temperature.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.880
But this is only true for
an ideal gas and it's

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:27.110
approximately true
for other things.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:37.660
So, delta u is equal
to zero for all

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:47.540
isothermal ideal gas processes.

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.660
And it's approximately
equal to zero for

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.720
all real gas processes.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:58.240
And so that means that delta
u is always calculable from

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:05.180
Cv(T) dT for any ideal
gas change.

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:08.470
So even if work is done,
it doesn't matter.

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:12.710
All you care about is what was
the temperature change?

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:19.410
And this is always the easy way
to calculate du, and it's

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:25.230
often the easy way to calculate
either q or w, using

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:26.410
the first law.

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:35.730
So, since du is equal to q plus
w, and for an isothermal

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:40.490
process this is equal
to zero, q = -w.

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:45.500
For an ideal gas, for an
isothermal process.

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:49.230
It simplifies your
life enormously.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:52.040
You don't have to
calculate much.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:56.500
OK, so it's time to stop, I did,
in fact, get caught up.

00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.200
I hope you didn't mind the
enhanced velocity.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:03.070
Now Bawendi can do the beautiful
stuff on lecture

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:04.040
number four.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.520
Thank you.
