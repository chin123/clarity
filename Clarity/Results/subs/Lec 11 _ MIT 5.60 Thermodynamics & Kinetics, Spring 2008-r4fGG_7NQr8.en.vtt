00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.430
PROFESSOR NELSON: All right,
well last time we finished our

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.460
sort of introduction to entropy
which is a difficult

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.020
topic, but I hope we got to the
point where we have some

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.350
working understanding of
physically what it's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.470
representing for us, and
also an ability to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.310
just calculate it.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.780
So we went through at the end
of the last lecture, a few

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.890
examples where we just
calculated changes in entropy

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.470
for simple processes like
heating and cooling something

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.140
or going through a phase
transition where that process,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.840
that sort of process is
relatively simple because

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.200
there's no temperature change.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.240
While the ice is melting, for
example, you're putting heat

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.530
into it, but the temperature
is staying

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.530
at zero degree Celsius.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.880
And we saw, how to do these
calculations, we need define

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.960
reversible paths.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.640
So it was extremely
straightforward to calculate

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.920
the entropy of say ice melting
at zero degrees Celsius,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.350
because there the process is
reversible, because that's the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.180
melting temperature.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.700
But if we wanted to calculate
the change in entropy of ice

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.520
melting, you know at, once it
had already been cooled to ten

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.330
degrees above the melting point,
to ten degrees Celsius,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.420
then in order to find a
reversible path, we had to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.650
say, OK, let's first cool it
down to zero degrees Celsius.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.580
Then let's have it melt, and
then let's warm the liquid

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.330
back up to ten degrees Celsius
so we could construct the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.060
sequence of reversible steps
that would get from the same

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.590
starting point to the same end
point, and we could calculate

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.770
the change in entropy through
that sort of sequence.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.630
So now that we've got at least
some experience doing

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.470
calculations of delta S and
we're just thinking a little

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.430
bit about entropy, what I'd like
to do is to try to relate

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.230
the state variables together
in a useful way.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.920
And and the immediate problem
that I'd like to address is

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.930
the fact that right now we
have kind of a cumbersome

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.180
expression for energy.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:29.890
So you know we have u, we look
at du, right it's dq plus dw,

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.330
and you know, I don't
like those.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.980
They're path specific, and it
would be nice to be able to do

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.390
a calculation of changes
in energy that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.630
didn't depend on path.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.650
You know it's a state
function.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.590
So in principle it seems like it
sure ought to be possible,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.490
and yet so far when we've
actually gone through

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.980
calculations of du, we've had
to go and consider the path

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.020
and get the heat and get
the work and so forth.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.470
And then we found special cases,
you know an ideal gas

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.460
where the temperature, where the
change is only a function

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.860
of temperature and so forth,
where we could write this as a

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.260
function of state variables,
but nothing general that

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.270
really allows us to do the
calculation under all

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.360
circumstances.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.130
So let's think about how
to make this better.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.840
So, and what I mean by that is
you've seen examples like, you

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.750
know, some special examples
you saw awhile back.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.560
The case where du was Cv dT
minus Cv and this Joule

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.350
coefficient d v. But you know
you still need to find those

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.600
coefficients for each system.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.980
This isn't a general equation
that tells us how energy

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.960
changes in terms of only
functions of state.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.600
Because of things like this and
this -- what I'd really

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:11.800
like is to be able to you know
write du equals something.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.440
And that something, you know,
it can have T and p and

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.700
whatever else I need.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.160
It can have S, H, and of course
differentials of any of

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.550
those quantities. dT or dp or
dS, dH, you name it, but all

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.400
state variables.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.760
That's what I'd much
rather have.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.260
And then, you know, if I want
to, if I've got something like

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.230
that and I want to find out how
the energy changes as a

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.970
function of volume, so I'll
calculate du/dV With respect

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.420
to some selected variable hold
constant, I can do it.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.530
Right now, in a general sense,
that's cumbersome.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.450
I've got to figure out how to
do that for each particular

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.740
case that I want to treat.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:13.520
So, let's see how we could
construct such a thing.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.580
Let's consider just a reversible
process, at

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:32.120
constant pressure.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:43.400
So, OK, I've got one and I'm
going to in some path wind up

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:51.100
at state two and I'll write du
is dq, it's reversible in this

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.810
case, minus p dV.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:08.410
And from the second law, we
know that we can write dq

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.520
reversible as T dS.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.360
dq over T is dS or entropy.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:28.150
So, we can write du is
T dS minus p dV.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.660
That's so important, we'll
circle it with colored chalk.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.850
That's how important it is.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.000
You know it's a dramatic
moment.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.640
So let's look at what
we have here.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.930
Here's du and over on this side
we have T, we have S, we

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.770
have p and we have V. Suddenly
and simply, it's only

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.550
functions of state.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.940
Well that was pretty easy.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:12.680
So, what that's telling us is
that we can write u this way,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.200
and you know, this is
generally true.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.390
We got to this by considering
a reversible

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.670
constant pressure process.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.020
But we know u is a state
variable right.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.130
So this result is going to
be generally applicable.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.090
And it tells us a couple
of things too.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:36.190
It tells us that in some sense,
the natural variables

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:50.980
for u are these, right, it's a
function of S and V. Those are

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.840
natural variables in the sense
that then it written as

00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:02.430
functions of those variables, we
only have state quantities

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.000
on the right-hand side.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.030
Very, very valuable
expression.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.230
And of course coming out of
that then, we can take

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:17.290
derivatives and at least for
those particular variables, we

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:26.430
can see that du/dS at constant
V is minus p.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:42.300
And du/dV at constant
S is T. All right,

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.930
those fall right out.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:49.770
Now we can have a similar set
of steps for H, for the

00:08:49.770 --> 00:09:10.090
enthalpy, so let's just
look at that.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:21.150
So H, of course, it's u plus
pV, so dH is just du plus

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:26.220
d(pV), and now there's our
expression for du.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.080
We're going to use
it this way.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:39.380
So it's T dS minus p dV
plus p dV plus V dp.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.370
And of course these are
going to cancel.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:51.420
So we can write dH is
T dS plus V dp.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.520
Also important enough
that we'll

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.760
highlight it a little bit.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.390
So again let's look at what
we've got on the right-hand

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:08.700
side here, T, S, V, p, only
quantities that are

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.220
functions of state.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.290
And of course, we can take the
corresponding derivative, so

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.180
let's also be explicit here,
that means that were writing H

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:28.110
as a function of the
variables S and p.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:53.400
And dH/dS at constant p is T,
and dH/dp at constant S is V.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.900
So now we've got a couple of
really surprisingly simple

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.600
expressions that we can use to
describe u and H in terms of

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.880
only state variables.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.080
All right?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.320
We also can go from these
expressions, using the chain

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.540
rule, to expressions for
particularly useful

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:23.260
expressions for the entropy as
a function of temperature.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:32.250
So, you know, from du
is T dS minus p dV.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:38.940
We can rewrite this as
dS is one over T du

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:44.870
plus p over T dV.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.430
And now we can go back, you
know, if we can go back to our

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:58.410
writing of u in terms of, as a
function of T and V, right.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:09.320
So we can write here du as a
function of T and V, Cv dT

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:17.650
plus du/dV at constant T dV.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:22.440
The reason we're doing that is
now we can rewrite dS is one

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.500
over T times Cv dT, and that's
the only temperature

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.990
dependence we're
going to have.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.760
The other part is going to
be a function of volume.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:45.250
So it's, we've got p over T plus
du/dV at constant T dV,

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:54.170
and what this says then is that
dS/dT at constant V is

00:12:54.170 --> 00:13:03.770
just Cv over T. Very useful, not
surprising because of the

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:08.280
relation between heat at
constant volume and Cv, right.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:15.730
And of course dS is just dq
reversible over T, but this is

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.600
telling us, in general, how
the entropy changes with

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.640
temperature at constant
volume.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.610
We can go through the exact same
procedure with the H to

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.110
look at how entropy varies with
temperature at constant

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.480
pressure, and we'll get exactly
an analogous set of

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.650
steps that will be
Cp over T, right.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:14:00.650
So also dS/dT at constant
pressure is Cp over T. OK?

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:05.200
Now I want to carry our
discussion a little bit

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.020
further and look at entropy a
little more carefully and in

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:15.380
particular, how it varies
with temperature.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.480
And here's what I really
want to look at.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.470
You know, we've talked about
when we look at changes in u

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.770
and changes in H, and we've
done this under lots of

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.360
circumstances at this point.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.300
And at various times I've
emphasized, and I'm sure

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.000
Professor Bawendi did too, that
when we look at these

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.350
quantities we can only define
changes in them.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.580
There's not an absolute scales
for energy or for enthalpy.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.640
We can set the zero in
a particular problem,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.350
arbitrarily.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:55.050
And so, for example, when we
talked about thermochemistry,

00:14:55.050 --> 00:15:00.490
we defined heats of formation,
and then we said, well, the

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:05.310
heat of formation of an element
in its natural state

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.390
at room temperature and pressure
we'll call zero.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.790
We called it zero.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.950
If we wanted to put some number
on it, and put energy

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.390
in it, we could have
done that.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.300
We defined the zero.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.230
So far, that's, well not just so
far, that's always the way

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.970
it will be for quantities like
energy and enthalpy.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.130
Entropy is different.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.520
So let's just see
how that works.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:52.230
So, let's consider the entropy,
we'll consider as a

00:15:52.230 --> 00:16:00.780
function of temperature
and pressure.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.360
First let's just see how it
varies with pressure.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.220
We're going to see -- what
we'll do is consider its

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.110
variation to both pressure and
temperature, and the objective

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.830
is to say all right, if I've
got some substance at any

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:15.020
arbitrary temperature and
pressure, can I define and

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.020
calculate an absolute number
for the entropy?

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.190
Not just a change in entropy,
unlike the cases with delta u

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:26.470
and delta H, but an absolute
number that says in absolute

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.480
terms the entropy of this
substance at room temperature

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.340
and pressure or whatever
temperature and pressure is

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.140
this amount.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:39.160
Something that I can do by
choice of a zero for energy or

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.680
for u or H, but here,
I want to look

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.920
for an absolute answer.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.510
All right, so let's start by
looking at the pressure

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.620
dependence.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:59.450
So we're going to start with du
is T dS minus p dV, so dS

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:07.130
is du plus p dV over T.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:14.230
Now let's look, T
being constant.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.910
OK, and now let's specify
a little bit.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.610
I want to make it something
as tractable as possible.

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:27.760
Let's go to an ideal gas.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.660
So then at constant temperature,
that says du is

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.650
equal to zero.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:41.680
So dS at constant temperature
is just p over T dV.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:57.750
And in the case of an ideal
gas, that's nR dV over V.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:08.110
And at constant temperature,
that means that d(nRT), which

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:19.470
is the same as d(pV) is equal
to zero, but this

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.790
is p dV plus V dp.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:34.210
So this says that dV over V,
that I've got there, is the

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:39.550
same thing as negative
dp over p.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:59.900
Right, so I can write that dS
as constant temperature is

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:06.980
minus nR dp over p.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.710
So that's great.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.720
That says now if I know the
entropy at some particular

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.350
pressure, I can calculate how
it changes as a function of

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:20.930
pressure, right.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:33.910
If I know S at some standard
pressure that we can define,

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:42.050
then S at some arbitrary
pressure, is just S of p

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:49.420
naught and T minus the integral
from p naught to p of

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.220
nR dp over p.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:20:01.940
All right, which is to say it's
S of p naught T minus nR

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.800
log of p over p naught.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:18.400
Right, now normally we'll
define p naught as

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.930
equal to one bar.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.750
And often you'll see this simply
written as nR log p.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.060
I don't particularly like to
do that because of course,

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.630
then, formally speaking were
looking at something that's

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.760
written that has units inside
as the argument of a log.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.660
Of course it's understood when
you see that, and you're

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.780
likely to see it in various
places, it's understood when

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.830
you see that the quantity p is
always supposed to be divided

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:53.050
by one bar, and the units
then are taken care of.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:21:01.600
For one mole, we can write the
molar quantities S of p and T,

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:16.400
is S, S naught of T minus
R log p over p naught.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:24.330
All right, so that's our
pressure dependence.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.820
What about that?

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.630
We still don't really have a
formulation for calculating

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.620
this, or you know, defining it
or whatever we're going to do

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:57.000
to allow us to know it.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.670
Well, let's just consider the
entropy as a function of

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.770
temperature, starting all the
way down at zero degrees

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.600
Kelvin, and going up to whatever
temperature we want

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:23.460
to consider.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.140
Now, we certainly do know how
to calculate delta S for all

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.750
that because we've seen how to
calculate delta S if you just

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.760
heat something up, and we've
seen how to calculate delta S

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.640
when something under goes a
phase transition, right.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.840
Presumably, if we're starting at
zero Kelvin, we're starting

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.780
in a solid state.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.490
As we heat it up, depending on
the material, it may melt at

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:47.090
some temperature.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.510
If we keep keep heating it
up, it'll boil at some

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:54.110
temperature, but we know how to
treat all of that, right.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.670
So let's just consider something
that undergoes that

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.130
set of changes.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:05.180
So, we've got some substance
A, solid, zero

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:13.480
degrees Kelvin, one bar.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.200
Here's process one.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.340
It goes to A, it's a solid
at the melting

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:29.500
temperature and one bar.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.570
Process two is it turns into
a liquid at the melting

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:41.430
temperature and one bar.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:50.750
Process three is we heat it up
some more, up to the boiling

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:56.190
temperature at one bar.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:03.010
Process four is it evaporates,
so now it's a gas at the

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:07.620
boiling temperature
and one bar.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:13.350
Finally, we heat it up some
more, so now it's a gas at

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:19.730
temperature T and one bar.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.510
And if we wanted to,
we can go further.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:26.200
We can make it a gas at
temperature and whatever

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:26.900
pressure we want.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:36.420
That part we already know how
to take care of, right.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.410
Well, let's look at what happens
to S, all right.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:46.110
S, a molar enthalpy at T and
p, where we're going to

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:56.000
finally end up, is, well it's s
zero at zero Kelvin and one

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.470
bar or one bar is implied by
the superscripts here.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:07.080
And then we have delta S for
step one, and delta S for step

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.730
two and so on.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:13.470
So all right, let's, we can
label this six so we to all

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:37.890
the way to delta
S for step six.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.400
Well, so we can do that.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:51.300
It's S of the material at T
and p is S naught at zero

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.620
Kelvin, plus, here's
for process one.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:01.310
We heat it up from zero Kelvin
up to the melting point.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:08.690
Cp of the solid more heat
capacity, divided by T dT.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:15.050
We can calculate delta S for
heating something up, right.

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:21.230
Plus, now we've got the heat of
fusion to melt the stuff,

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:28.310
so it's just delta H naught of
fusion, divided by Tm right.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.250
We saw that last time.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.890
In other words, remember,
we're just looking at q

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:38.160
reversible over T to get delta
S, and it's just given by the

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.640
heat of fusion.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.910
All right, then let's go from
the melting point to the

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:45.830
boiling point.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:50.200
So it's Cp now it's the heat
capacity, the molar heat

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.920
capacity of the liquid,
divided by T dT.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.540
We're heating up the liquid.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.550
And then there's vaporization.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:11.200
Delta H of vaporization over
T at the boiling point.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.050
Then we can go from the boiling
point to our final

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:19.880
temperature T. Now it's the
molar heat capacity of the gas

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:29.440
over T dT minus R log
p over p naught.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.200
OK, so that's everything, and
these are all things that we

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.160
know how to do.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.790
Just about.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.300
OK, this one we're going to have
to think about, but all

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.530
the changes we know how
to calculate, right.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:56.000
So if we plot this, S, and
let's just do this as a

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
function of temperature.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.360
I don't have pressure
in here explicitly.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:08.770
Well, it's going to change as
I warm up the solid, soon

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:14.750
we're really starting
at zero Kelvin.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.690
This stuff is all positive,
right, so the change in

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.810
entropy is going
to be positive.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:23.070
Entropy is going to increase
as this happens, and then

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.450
there's a change right at some
fixed temperature as the

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:30.210
material melts.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.570
So here is step one.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.220
Here is step two, right, this
must be the melting

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.170
temperature.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:45.130
And then there's another
heating step.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.590
Well, strictly speaking, I'm
going to run out of space here

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:52.430
if I'm not careful, so I'm
going to be a little more

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.470
careful here.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.930
One, two, three.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.690
I'm heating it up
a little more.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.650
Entropy is still increasing,
right.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.520
So I've done this.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.670
I've done this.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.870
Now I've heated up the liquid.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.760
Now, I'm going to boil the
liquid, so it's going to have

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.100
some change in entropy.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.770
This must be my boiling point,
and now there's some further

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.550
change in the gas, and that gets
me to whatever my final

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:32.040
temperature is, right, that
I'm going to reach.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:36.700
Four and five, great.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:42.020
So there is monotonic increase
in the entropy.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:52.380
OK, so we're there, except
for this value.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:59.760
That one stinking
little number --

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.530
S naught at zero Kelvin.

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:07.320
That's the only thing we
don't know so far.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:13.470
So, for this we need some
additional input.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:17.610
We got some input of the
sort that we need

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:18.820
in 1905 from Nernst.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:26.810
Nernst deduced that as you go
down from zero Kelvin for any

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:31.130
process, the change in entropy
gets smaller and smaller.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:35.690
It approaches zero.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:38.490
Now, that actually was certainly
an important

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:43.360
advance, but it was superseded
by such an important advance

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.280
that I'm not even going to
reward it by placing it on the

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.380
blackboard.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.430
Forget highlight, color,
forget it.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:59.550
Because Planck, six years later,
in 1911, deduced a

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:04.480
stronger statement which
is extremely useful,

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.200
and it's the following.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:11.120
What he showed is that as
temperature approaches zero

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.730
Kelvin, for a pure
substance in it's

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:20.620
crystalline state, S is zero.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.990
A much stronger statement,
right.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:27.350
A stronger statement than the
idea that changes in S get

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:30.180
very small as you approach
zero Kelvin.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.100
No, he's saying we can make a
statement about that absolute

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:39.240
number S goes to zero as
temperature goes to zero.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.380
For a pure substance in it's
crystalline state.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:48.310
So that is monumentally
important.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:32:14.680
So as T goes to zero Kelvin, S
goes to zero, for every pure

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:21.600
substance in its, and I'll
sort of interject here,

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:30.640
perfect crystalline state.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.690
That's really an
amazing result.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:36.420
So what it's saying is I'm
down at zero Kelvin.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.310
Minimally, I've somehow cooled
it as much as I possibly

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.930
could, and I've got my perfect
crystal lattice.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.380
It could be an atomic crystal
like this, or, you know, it

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.560
could be molecules.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.060
But they're all exactly where
they belong in their locations

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.520
in the crystal, and the absolute
entropy is something

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.960
I can define and it's zero.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.030
So S equals zero.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:19.160
Perfect, pure crystal,
all right.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:26.860
OK, well this came out of a
microscopic description of

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:32.180
entropy that I briefly alluded
to last lecture, and again

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.620
we'll go into in more detail
in a few lectures hence.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:42.400
But the result that I mentioned,
the general result,

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:48.120
was that S was R over Na
Avogadro's number, times the

00:33:48.120 --> 00:34:07.800
log of this omega number of
microscopic states available

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.210
to the system that
I'm considering.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:14.000
Now normally for a macroscopic
system, I've got just an

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.530
astronomical number of
microscopic states.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.680
You know, that could mean in
a liquid, different little

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.930
configurations of the molecules
around each other.

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.940
They're all different states.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:33.660
Huge amounts of possible states,
and the gas even more.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.060
But if I go to zero Kelvin,
and I've got a perfect

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.080
crystal, every atom,
every molecule is

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.680
exactly in its place.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.900
How many possible different
states is that?

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.600
It's one.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.230
There aren't any more
possible states.

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:55.880
I've localized every identical
lateral molecule in its

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.850
particular place,
and it's done.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:03.490
And you know, if I start
worrying about the various

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:06.780
things that would matter under
ordinary conditions, right,

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.080
you know, maybe at higher
temperature, I'd have some

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.100
molecules in excited
vibration levels or

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.740
maybe electronic levels.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.970
Maybe if it's hydrogen,
maybe everything isn't

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:18.860
in the ground state.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.770
It's not all in the 1s orbital
but in higher levels.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.790
Then there's be lots of states
available, right, even of only

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:28.350
one atom in the whole crystal
is excited, well there's one

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:30.690
state that would have
it be this atom.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.020
A different one would have it
be this atom, and so forth.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.960
Already, there'd be an enormous
number of states, but

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.320
at zero Kelvin, there's no
thermal lexitation of any of

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.960
that stuff.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.230
Things are in the lowest states,
and they're in their

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.450
proper positions.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:52.100
There's only one state for the
whole system, so that's why

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:56.030
the entropy is zero in
a perfect crystal.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:36:01.610
At zero degrees Kelvin.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:05.310
Now, there are things that may
appear to violate that.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.480
Now of course you can make
measurements of entropy,

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:14.800
right, so it can be verified
that this is the case.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.440
There are some things
that would appear to

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.750
violate that result.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.670
You know, you can make
measurements of entropies, and

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:29.860
for example let's take carbon
monoxide crystal, CO.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.200
So let's say this is
a crystal lattice,

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.800
it's diatomic molecules.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.500
It's carbon oxygen carbon
oxygen carbon oxygen.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.370
All there in perfect place
in the crystal lattice.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:45.710
Well it turns out when you form
the crystal every now and

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:51.880
then -- you know, let's
put it in color.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.690
Let's put it in the color that
we'll use to signify something

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:01.250
in some way evil.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.140
No insult to people who
like that color.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.100
I kind of like it in fact.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:12.020
OK, so you know, you're making
the crystal, cooling it,

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.500
started out maybe in the gas
phase, start cooling it,

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.140
starts crystallizing.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:22.870
Gets colder and colder, but you
know, carbon monoxide is

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.820
pretty easy for those things
to flip sides.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.030
And even in the crystalline
state, even though it's a

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.990
crystal, so the molecules center
of mass are all where

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:35.150
they belong, still at ordinary
temperatures they will be able

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.890
to rotate a bit.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:40.280
So even in the crystalline
state, when it's originally

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.380
formed, not at zero Kelvin,
there's thermal energy around.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.360
These things can to get knocked
around, and the

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.020
orientations can change.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.350
Now you start cooling it, and
you know, by and large they'll

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:54.010
all go into the proper
orientation.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:57.500
Right, that's the lowest energy
state, but you know,

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.640
there are all sorts of kinetic
things involved.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.710
There it takes time for the
flipping, depending on how

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:05.310
long, how slowly it was
cooled, and so forth.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.390
May never happen, and then it's
cooled, and then anything

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.230
that's left in the
other orientation

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.370
is frozen in there.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:13.680
There's no thermal
energy anymore.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.470
It can't find a way
to reorient.

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.210
That's it.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.010
All right, let's say we're down
to zero Kelvin, and out

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.040
of the whole crystal, we've
got a mole of molecules.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.560
One of them is in the
wrong orientation.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.080
Now how many states do
we have like that

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.130
that would be possible?

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.020
We'd have a mole of
states, right.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.690
It could be this one.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.470
It could be that one, right.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:38.480
Or in general, of course
really there's a whole

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.160
distribution of them, and they
could be anywhere, and pairs

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.790
of them could be, and it doesn't
take long to get to

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:47.340
really large numbers.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.390
So the entropy won't be zero.

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.310
Entropy of a perfect
crystal would mean

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:54.460
it's perfectly ordered.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.970
So that's zero.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.980
But things like that not
withstanding, and of course

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.520
it's the same if you have
a mixed crystal.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.920
In a sense I've described a
mixed crystal where the

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.590
mixture is a mixture of carbon
monoxide pointing this way,

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.680
and carbon monoxide
pointing this way.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.580
But a real mixed crystal with
two different constituents,

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.970
well of course, then you
have all the possible

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.790
configurations where, you know,
they could be here and

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.800
here and here, and then you
could move one of them around

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.480
and so forth, there
are zillions

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.880
and zillions of states.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.920
But for a pure crystal, in
perfect form, you really have

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.895
only one configuration,
and your entropy

00:39:32.895 --> 00:39:34.600
is therefore zero.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:44.490
OK, so now, we can go back
and we can do this.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:47.100
And at least in principle, even
for things that don't

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.720
form perfect crystals, we could
calculate the change in

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:54.190
entropy going from the perfect
ordered crystal to something

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.930
else with some degree of
disorder and keep going and

00:39:56.930 --> 00:40:00.130
change the temperature and
do all these things.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.970
So the real point is that this
is extremely powerful because

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.400
given this, we really can
calculate absolute numbers for

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.640
the entropies of substances, at
ordinary, not just at zero

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.280
Kelvin, but using this which,
you know, this is a really

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.390
very straightforward
procedure.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:18.790
And in fact these things are
really quite easy to measure.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.530
You know, you do calorimetry,
you can measure those delta H

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:25.240
of fusions, right, delta
H of vaporization.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.400
You can measure the heat
capacities, the things in the

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.160
calorimeter.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.370
You'll see how much heat
is needed to raise the

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:31.230
temperature a degree.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.405
That give you your heat capacity
for the gas or the

00:40:33.405 --> 00:40:34.630
liquid or the solid.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:37.930
So in fact, it's extremely
practical to make all those

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.680
measurements, and you can easily
find those values of

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.710
the heat capacities and the
delta H's tabulated for a huge

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.190
number of substances.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.620
So this is, in fact, the
practical procedure then of

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.140
protocol for calculating
absolute entropies of all

00:40:54.140 --> 00:41:00.960
sorts of materials at ordinary
temperatures and pressures.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.690
Very important.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:12.000
Now, one of those corollaries
to this law is that in fact

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.010
it's impossible to reduce the
temperature of any substance,

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:20.680
any system, all the way
to absolute, exact, no

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.000
approximations, zero Kelvin.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Because you can't quite get
down to zero Kelvin.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.600
And there are various ways that
you can see that this

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:43.280
must be the case.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:53.250
But here's one way to
think about it.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:42:08.300
So, let's just write
that first.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:16.420
All right, can't get quite
down to zero Kelvin.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:29.130
All right, let's consider
a mole of an ideal gas.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:41.160
So p is RT over V. And let's
start at T1 and V1, and now

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.900
let's bring it down to some
lower temperature, T2 in some

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.640
spontaneous process.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.490
We'll make it adiabatic
so it's like an

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:53.450
irreversible expansion.

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:57.440
I just want to calculate what
delta S would be there in

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.310
terms of T and V.

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:21.400
So, well, du is T
dS minus p dV.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:33.700
dS is du over T plus
p over T dV.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:42.370
But we can also write du is
Cv dT in this case, right?

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:55.080
So that says that p over T,
that's R over V, and we can

00:43:55.080 --> 00:44:31.106
write, dS is Cv dT over T plus
R dV over V. It's Cv, I'll

00:44:31.106 --> 00:44:49.300
write it as d(log T) plus R
d(log V), and so delta S, Cv

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:56.180
log of T2 minus log of T1, if
T2 is my final temperature,

00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:07.350
plus R log of V2 minus
log of V1, okay.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:16.940
Or Cv log of T2 over T1 plus
R log of V2 over V1.

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:35.290
Well, what does it mean
when T2 is zero?

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:41.510
Well, I don't know
what it means.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:51.880
This turns into negative
infinity.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:57.010
So we're going to write it again
as our either evil or at

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:00.030
least unattainable color.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.590
What's going to happen?

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:06.850
I mean you could say, well, we
can counteract it by having

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:08.890
this go to plus infinity,
right.

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:11.930
Make the volume infinite.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.945
In other words, have the
expansion be in through an

00:46:13.945 --> 00:46:14.970
infinite volume.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:18.180
Of course that's impossible.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.620
That would be the only
way to counteract the

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:24.280
divergence of this term.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:29.370
In practice, you really cannot
get to absolute zero, but it

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.660
is possible to get
extremely close.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.110
That's doable experimentally.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:38.040
It's possible to get down to
some micro or nano Kelvin

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.560
temperatures, right.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:49.420
In fact, our MIT physicist,
Wolfgang Ketterle, by bringing

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.370
atoms and molecules down to
extremely low temperatures,

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:57.290
was able to see them all reach
the very lowest possible

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.100
quantum state available
to them.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.500
All sorts of unusual properties
emerge in that kind

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:06.510
of state, where the atoms and
molecules behave coherently.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:10.290
You can make matter waves,
right, and see interferences

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.740
among them because of the fact
that they're all in this

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.730
lowest quantum state.

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:17.780
So it is possible to get
extremely low temperatures,

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:23.130
but never absolute zero.

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:34.240
Here's another way to
think about it.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.320
You could consider what happens
to the absolute

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:56.790
entropy, starting at T
equals zero, right.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:00.220
So we already saw that, you
know, that we can go, the

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.310
first step will go from zero to
some temperature of Cp over

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:11.880
T for the solid dT if we start
at zero Kelvin and warm up.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.710
Now, already we've
got a problem.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:23.390
If this initial temperature
really is zero, what happens?

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:26.530
This diverge, right.

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:31.820
Well, in fact, what that
suggests is as you approach

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:40.380
zero Kelvin, the heat capacity
also approaches zero.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:54.340
So, does this go to infinity as
T approaches zero Kelvin?

00:48:54.340 --> 00:49:05.450
Well, not if Cp of the solid
approaches zero as T

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:09.320
approaches zero Kelvin.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:15.910
And in fact, we can measure Cp,
heat capacities at very

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:20.050
low temperatures, and what
we find is, they do.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:27.860
They do go to zero as you
approach zero Kelvin.

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:35.530
So in fact, Cp of T approaches
zero as T

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:38.700
approaches zero Kelvin.

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.320
Good!

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:49.020
But one thing that this says is,
remember, that dT is dq at

00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.700
the heat in divided by Cp.

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:58.200
And this is getting really,
really small.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.720
It's going to zero
as temperature

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.370
goes to zero, right.

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:03.440
Which means that this
is enormous.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:09.770
What it says is even the tiniest
amount the heat input

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:15.130
leads to a significant change
increase in the temperature.

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:17.540
So, this is another way of
understanding why it just

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:21.380
becomes impossible to lower the
temperature of a system to

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:25.700
absolute zero, because any kind
of contact, and I mean

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.470
any kind, like let's
say you've got the

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:29.000
system in some cryostat.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.790
Of course the walls of the
cryostat aren't at zero

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.650
Kelvin, but somewhere in here
it's at zero Kelvin.

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:36.300
You can say, okay I won't
won't make it in

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.870
contact with the walls.

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:44.540
You can try, but actually light,
photons that emit from

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:47.450
the walls go into the sample.

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:50.800
You wouldn't think that heats
something up very much, and it

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.160
doesn't heat it up very
much, but we're not

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.170
talking about very much.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:57.400
It does heat it up by enough
that you can't get the

00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.850
absolute zero.

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:02.660
In other words, somehow it will
be in contact with stuff

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:06.880
around that is not at absolute
zero Kelvin.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.910
And even that kind of radiative
contact is enough,

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:16.730
in fact, to make it not
reach absolute zero.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:19.610
So the point is, one way or
another, you can easily see

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:23.090
that it becomes impossible to
keep pulling heat out of

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:26.770
something and keep it down at
the temperature that's right

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:30.310
there at zero, but again it's
possible to get very close.

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:33.620
All right, what we're going to
be able to do next time is

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:37.180
take what we've seen so far, and
develop the conditions for

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:38.200
reaching equilibrium.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.640
So in a general sense, we'll be
able to tell which way the

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.480
processes go left unto
themselves to move toward

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.730
equilibrium.
