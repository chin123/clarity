00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.920
PROFESSOR: Thermodynamics,
all right, let's start.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:31.270
Thermodynamics is the science
of the flow of heat.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.680
So, thermo is heat,
and dynamics is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.300
the motion of heat.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.730
Thermodynamics was developed
largely beginning in the

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.750
1800's, at the time of the
Industrial Revolution.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.890
So, taming of steel.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.200
The beginning of generating
power by burning fossil fuels.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.570
The beginning of the problems
with CO2 and [NOISE OBSCURES]

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.210
global warming.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.870
In fact, it's interesting
to note that the first

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.970
calculation on the impact of CO2
on climate was done in the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.170
late 1800's by Arrhenius.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.130
Beginning of a generation of
power moving heat from fossil

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.920
fuels to generating energy,
locomotives, etcetera.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.360
So, he calculated what would
happen to this burning of

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.520
fossil fuels, and he decided
in his calculation, he

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.380
basically got the calculation
right, by the way, but he came

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.720
out that in 2,000 years from
the time that he did the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.380
calculations, humans would
be in trouble.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.090
Well, since his calculation,
we've had an exponential

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.150
growth in the amount of CO2,
and if you go through the

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.220
calculations of -- people have
done these calculations

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.190
throughout times since
Arrhenius, the time that we're

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.500
in trouble, 2,000 years and the
calculation, has gone like

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.250
this, and so now we're
really in trouble.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.150
That's for a different
lecture.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.590
So, anyway, thermodynamics dates
from the same period as

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.180
getting fossil fuels
out of the ground.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.160
It's universal.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.310
It turns out everything around
us moves energy around in one

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.850
way or the other.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.090
If you're a biological system,
you're burning calories,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.500
burning ATP.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.980
You're creating heat.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.040
If you're a warm-blooded
animal.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.640
You need energy to move your
arms around and move around --

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.590
mechanical systems, obviously,
cars, boats, etcetera.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.900
And even in astrophysics, when
you talk about stars, black

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.600
holes, etcetera, you're
moving energy around.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.830
You're moving heat around when
you're changing matter through

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.190
thermodynamics.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.610
And the cause of some
thermodynamics have even been

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.340
applied to economics, systems
out of equilibrium, like big

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.900
companies like Enron, you
know, completely out of

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.900
equilibrium, crash and burn.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.520
You can apply non-equilibrium
thermodynamics to economics.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.430
It was developed before
people knew

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.630
about atoms and molecules.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.420
So it's a science that's
based on macroscopic

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.480
properties of matter.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.370
Since then, since we know about
atoms and molecules now,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.990
we can rationalize the concepts
of thermodynmamics

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.840
using microscopic properties,
and if you are going to take

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.470
5.62, that's what you'd
learn about.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.010
You'd learn about statistical
mechanics, and how the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.840
atomistic concepts rationalize
thermodynamics.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.970
It doesn't prove it, but it
helps to getting more

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.680
intuition about the
consequences of

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.570
thermodynamics.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.790
So it applies to macroscopic
systems that are in

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.340
equilibrium, and how to go from
one equilibrium state to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.880
another equilibrium state, and
it's entirely empirical in its

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.730
foundation.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.270
People have done experiments
through the ages, and they've

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.310
accumulated the knowledge from
these experiments, and they've

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.210
synthesized these experiments
into a few basic empirical

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.610
rules, empirical laws,
which are the laws of

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.840
thermodynamics.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.415
And then they've taken these
laws and added a structure of

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:30.460
math upon it, to build this
edifice, which is a very solid

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.820
edifice of thermodynamics
as a science

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.810
of equilibrium systems.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.850
So these empirical observations
then are

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.410
summarized into four laws.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.380
So, these laws are, they're
really depillars.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.950
They're not proven, but
they're not wrong.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.340
They're very unlikely
to be wrong.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.810
Let's just go through these
laws, OK, very quickly.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.900
There's a zeroth law The zeroth
law every one of these

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.540
laws basically defines the
quantity in thermodynamics and

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.330
then defines the concept.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.770
The zeroth law defines
temperature.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.000
That's a fairly common-sense
idea, but it's important to

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.090
define it, and I call that
the common-sense law.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:30.150
So this is the common-sense
law.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:37.800
The first law ends up defining
energy, which we're going to

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.680
call u, and the concept of
energy conservation, energy

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.880
can't be lost or gained.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.900
And I'm going to call this the
you can break even law; you

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.100
can break even law.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.000
You don't lose energy, you
can't gain energy.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.090
You break even.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:09.585
The second law is going to
define entropy, and is going

00:06:09.585 --> 00:06:11.820
to tell us about the direction
of time, something that

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.500
conceptually we, clearly,
understand, but is going to

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.190
put a mathematical foundation
on which way does time go.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.180
Clearly, if I take a chalk
like this one here, and I

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.290
throw it on the ground, and it
breaks in little pieces, if I

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.110
run the movie backwards, that
doesn't make sense, right?

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.900
We have a concept of time
going forward in

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.370
a particular way.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.190
How does entropy play into
that concept of time?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:48.750
And I'm going to call this the
you can break even at zero

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.510
degrees Kelvin law.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.560
You can only do it at
zero degrees Kelvin.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:06.200
The third law is going to give
a numerical value to the

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.940
entropy, and the third law is
going to be the depressing

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:23.570
one, and it's going to say, you
can't get to zero degrees.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.690
These laws are universally
valid.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.820
They cannot be circumvented.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.620
Certainly people have tried
to do that, and every year

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.830
there's a newspaper story, Wall
Street Journal, or New

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.070
York Times about somebody that
has invented the device that

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.380
somehow goes around the second
law and makes more energy than

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.120
it creates, and this is going
to be -- well, first of all,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.090
for the investors this is going
to make them very, very

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:57.040
rich, and for the rest of us,
it's going to be wonderful.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.760
And they go through these
arguments, and they find

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.090
venture money to fund the
company, and they get very

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.530
famous people to endorse
them, etcetera.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.770
But you guys know, because you
have MIT degrees, and you've,

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.080
later, and you've taken 5.60,
that can't be the case, and

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.876
you're not going to get fooled
into investing money into

00:08:16.876 --> 00:08:18.470
these companies.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.980
But it's amazing, that every
year you find somebody coming

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.330
up with a way of going around
the second law and somehow

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:36.090
convincing people who are very
smart that this will work.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.890
So, thermo is also a big tease,
as you can see from my

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.230
descriptions of these
laws here.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.860
It makes you believe, initially,
in the feasibility

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.800
of perfect efficiency.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.190
The first law is very upbeat.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.490
It talks about the conservation
of energy.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.860
Energy is conserved in
all of its forms.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.740
You can take heat energy and
convert it to work energy and

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.880
vice versa, and it doesn't say
anything about that you have

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.860
to waste heat if you're going
to transform heat into work.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.870
It just says it's energy.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.350
It's all the same
thing, right?

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.230
So, you could break even if you
were very clever about it,

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.400
and that's pretty neat.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.510
So, in a sense, it says, you
know, if you wanted to build a

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:29.550
boat that took energy out of the
warmth of the air, to sail

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.740
around the world,
you can do that.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.530
And then the second law comes
in and says well, that's not

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.040
quite right.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.970
The second law says, yes, energy
is pretty much the same

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.040
in all this form, but if you
want to convert one form of

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.720
energy into another, if you
want to convert work, heat

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.020
into work, with 100% efficiency,
you've got to go

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.250
down to zero degrees Kelvin, to
absolute zero if you want

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:57.870
to do that.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.050
Otherwise you're going to
waste some of that heat

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.920
somewhere along the way,
some of that energy.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.960
All right, so you can't get
perfect efficiency, but at

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.280
least if you were able to go to
zero degrees Kelvin, then

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.520
you'd be all set.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.200
You just got to find a good
refrigerator on your boat, and

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.250
then you can still go
around the world.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.690
And then the third law comes
in, and that's the

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.810
depressing part here.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.710
It says, well, it's true.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.980
If you could get to zero degrees
Kelvin, you'd get

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.705
perfect efficiency, but you
can't get to zero degrees

00:10:27.705 --> 00:10:31.180
Kelvin, you can't.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.180
Even if you have an infinite
amount of resources,

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:42.750
you can't get there.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:48.940
Any questions so far?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.720
So thermodynamics, based on
these four laws now, requires

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.420
an edifice, and it's a very
mature science, and it

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.600
requires that we define
things carefully.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.120
So we're going to spend a little
bit of time making sure

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.410
we define our concepts and our
words, and what you'll find

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:13.680
that when you do problem sets,
especially at the beginning,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.720
understanding the words and the
conditions of the problem

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.260
sets is most of the way into
solving the problem.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:33.560
So we're going to talk about
things like systems.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.110
The system, it's that
part of the

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.670
universe that we're studying.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.260
These are going to be fairly
common-sense definitions, but

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.390
they're important, and when
you get to a problem set,

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:50.440
really nailing down what the
system is, not more, nor less,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.160
in terms of the amount of stuff,
that's part of the

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.940
system, it's going to be
often very crucial.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.090
So you've got the system.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.010
For instance, it could
be a person.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:11:59.850
I am the system.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:00.620
I could be a system.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.450
It could be a hot coffee
in a thermos.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.620
So the coffee and the milk and
whatever else you like in your

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.920
coffee would be the system.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.140
It could be a glass of
water with ice in it.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.520
That's a fine system.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.220
Volume of air in a
part of a room.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.420
Take four liters on this
corner of the room.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.570
That's my system.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:28.950
Then, after you define what your
system is, whatever is

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.190
left over of the universe
is the surroundings.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.570
So, if I'm the system, then
everything else is the

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:35.860
surroundings.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.500
You are my surroundings.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.370
Saturn is my surroundings.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.340
As far as you can go in the
universe, that's part of the

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.300
surroundings.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.600
And then between the
system and the

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.120
surroundings is the boundary.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:56.990
And the boundary is a surface
that's real, like the outsides

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:01.740
of my skin, or the inner wall
of the thermos that has the

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.030
coffee in it, or it could be
an imaginary boundary.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.340
For instance, I can imagine that
there is a boundary that

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.220
surrounds the four liters of
air that's sitting in the

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:12.700
corner there.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.790
It doesn't have to be a real
container to contain it.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:21.420
It's just an imaginary
boundary there.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.180
And where you place that
boundary becomes important.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.210
So, for instance, for the
thermos with the coffee in it,

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.300
if you place the boundary in the
inside wall of the glass

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.600
or the outside wall of the glass
and the inside of the

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.560
thermos, that makes a
difference; different heat

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.740
capacity, etcetera.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.260
So this becomes where defining
the system and the boundaries,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
and everything becomes
important.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.970
You've got to place the boundary
at exactly the right

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.180
place, otherwise you've got a
bit too much in your system or

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.630
a bit too little.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.420
More definitions.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:59.170
The system can be an open
system, or it can be a closed

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:06.590
system, or it can be isolated.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.030
The definitions are also
important here.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:16.200
An open system, as the name
describes, allows mass and

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.980
energy to freely flow through
the boundary.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:37.690
Mass and energy flow
through boundary.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:38.680
Mass and energy --

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.630
I'm an open system, right?

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.910
Water vapor goes through
my skin.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:53.210
I'm hot, compared to the air
of the room, or cold if I'm

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.780
somewhere that's warm.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.420
So energy can go
back and forth.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:02.450
The thermos, with the lid on
top, is not an open system.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.890
Hopefully, your coffee is going
to stay warm or hot in

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:05.850
the thermos.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.440
It's not going to get out.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.080
So the thermos is not
an open system.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.320
In fact, the thermos is
an isolated system.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.270
The isolated system is the
opposite of the open system,

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.060
no mass and no energy can flow
through the boundary.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.700
The closed system allows energy
to transfer through the

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.320
boundary but not mass.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.080
So a closed system would be, for
instance, a glass of ice

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.220
water with an ice cube in
it, with the lid on top.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.580
The glass is not very
insulating.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.720
Energy can flow across the
glass, but I put a lid on top,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.350
and so the water
can't get out.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.060
And that's the closed system.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:50.230
Energy goes through the
boundaries but nothing else.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.900
Important definitions, even
though they may sound really

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.980
kind of dumb, but they are
really important, because when

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.100
you get the problem, figuring
out whether you have an open,

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.460
closed, or isolated system,
what are the surroundings?

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.240
What's the boundary?

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.360
What is the system?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.100
That's the first thing to
make sure that is clear.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.710
If it's not clear, the problem
is going to be

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:14.200
impossible to solve.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.060
And that's also how people find
ways to break the second

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.520
law, because somehow they've
messed up on what

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.670
their system is.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.600
And they've included too much
or too little in the system,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.640
and it looks to them that the
second law is broken and

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.710
they've created more energy
than is being brought in.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.040
That's usually the case.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.650
Questions?

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.880
Let's keep going.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.140
So, now that we've got
a system, we've

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.060
got to describe it.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:57.310
So, let's describe
the system now.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:02.120
It turns out that when you're
talking about macroscopic

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.480
properties of matter, you don't
need very many variables

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.500
to describe the system
completely thermodynamically.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.110
You just need a few macroscopic
variables that are

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.875
very familiar to you, like the
pressure, the temperature, the

00:17:18.875 --> 00:17:22.970
volume, the number of moles of
each component, the mass of

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.760
the system.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.910
You've got a magnetic field,
maybe even magnetic

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.330
susceptibility, the
electric field.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.750
We're not going to worry about
these magnetic fields or

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.620
electric fields in this class.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.590
So, pretty much we're going
to focus on this set

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.580
of variables here.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.670
You're going to have to know
when you describe the system,

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:48.020
if your system is homogeneous,
like your coffee with milk in

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.740
it, or heterogeneous, like water
with an ice cube in it.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.760
So heterogeneous means that
you've got different phases in

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.640
your system.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.440
I'm the heterogeneous system,
soft stuff, hard

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.340
stuff, liquid stuff.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.730
Coffee is homogeneous, even
though it's made up of many

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.440
components.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.850
Many different kinds of
molecules make up your coffee.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.190
There are the water molecules,
the flavor molecules, the milk

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.560
proteins, etcetera.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.930
But it's all mixed
up together in a

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.100
homogeneous, macroscopic fashion.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.640
If you drill down at the level
of molecules you see that it's

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.010
not homogeneous.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.590
But thermodynamics takes
a bird's eye view.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.760
It looks pretty, beautiful.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.410
So, that's a homogeneous
system, one phase.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.250
You have to know if your system
is an equilibrium

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.070
system or not.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.370
If it's an equilibrium system,
then thermodynamics can

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.750
describe it.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.810
If it's not, then you're going
to have trouble describing it

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.890
using thermodynamic
properties.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.440
Thermodynamics talks about
equilibrium systems and how to

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.910
go from one state of equilibrium
to another state

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.810
of equilibrium.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:56.480
What does equilibrium mean?

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.490
It means that the properties of
the system, the properties

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:04.140
that describe the system,
don't change

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.640
in time or in space.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.110
If I've got a gas in a
container, the pressure of the

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.510
gas has to be the same
everywhere in the container,

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.880
otherwise it's not
equilibrium.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.930
If I place my container of gas
on the table here, and I come

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.020
back an hour later, the pressure
needs to be the same

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.680
when I come back.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.760
Otherwise it's not
equilibrium.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.570
So it only talks about
equilibrium systems.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.920
What else do you need to know?

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.990
So, you need to know
the variables.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.250
You need to know it's
heterogeneous or homogeneous.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.260
You need to know if it's an
equilibrium, and you also need

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:47.820
to know how many components
you have in your system.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.800
So, a glass of ice water with an
ice cube in it, which is a

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.470
heterogeneous system, has
only one component,

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.110
which is water, H2O.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.980
Two phases, but one component.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.860
Latte, which is a homogeneous
system, has a very, very large

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.370
number of components to it.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.020
All the components that
make up the milk.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.550
All the components that make
up the coffee, and all the

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.770
impurities, etcetera. cadmium,
heavy metals, arsenic,

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:22.050
whatever is in your coffee.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:26.100
OK, any questions?

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.480
All right, so we've described
the system with these

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.040
properties.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.040
Now these properties come
in two flavors.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.650
You have extensive properties
and intensive properties.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:43.230
The extensive properties are the
ones that scale with the

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.370
size of the system.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.890
If you double the system,
they double in

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.700
there numerical number.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.090
For instance, the volume.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:54.010
If you double the volume,
the v doubles.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.400
I mean that's obvious.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.100
The mass, if you double
the amount of stuff

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.780
the mass will double.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.610
Intensive properties don't
care about the

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.860
scale of your system.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.730
If you double everything in the
system, the temperature is

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.540
not going to change, it's
not going to double.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.050
The temperature stays
the same.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.280
So the temperature is intensive,
and you can make

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.170
intensive properties out of the
extensive properties by

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:24.250
dividing by the number of
moles in the system.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.920
So I can make a quantity that
I'll call V bar, which is the

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.370
molar volume, the volume of one
mole of a component in my

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:37.270
system, and that becomes
an intensive quantity.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.650
A volume which is an
intensive volume.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:51.460
The volumes per mole
of that stuff.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.480
So, as I mentioned,
thermodynamics is the science

00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:05.260
of equilibrium systems, and it
also describes the evolution

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.510
of one equilibrium to
another equilibrium.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.770
How do you go from
one to the other?

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:13.850
And so the set of properties
that describes the system --

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.550
the equilibrium doesn't
change.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.250
So, these on-changing properties
that describe the

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.400
state of the equilibrium
state of the system are

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.410
called state variables.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:36.090
So the state variables describe
the equilibrium's

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.500
state, and they don't care about
how this state got to

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.800
where it is.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.760
They don't care about the
history of the state.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.980
They just know that's if you
have water at zero degrees

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.490
Celsius with it ice in, that
you can define it as a

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:58.570
heterogeneous system with a
certain density for the water

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.350
or certain density for the
ice, etcetera, etcetera.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.330
It doesn't care how
you got there.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.960
We're going to find other
properties that do care about

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.730
the history of the system, like
work, that you put in the

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.450
system, or heat that you
put in the system,

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.330
or some other variables.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:18.180
But you can't use those to
define the equilibrium state.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.830
You can only use the
state variables,

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.250
independent of history.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.980
And it turns out that for a
one component system, one

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:30.110
component meaning one kind of
molecule in the system, all

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:34.400
that you need to know to
describe the system is the

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:41.960
number of moles for a one
component system, and to

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.280
describe one phase in that
system, one component,

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:53.770
homogeneous system, you need
n and two variables.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:58.810
For instance, the pressure and
the temperature, or the volume

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.450
and the pressure.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.700
If you have the number of
moles and two intensive

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.210
variables, then you know
everything there is to know

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:07.790
about the system.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.190
About the equilibrium state
of that system.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:17.200
There are hundreds of quantities
that you can

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.590
calculate and measure that are
interesting and important

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:23.610
properties, and all you need is
just a few variables to get

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.020
everything out, and that's
really the power of

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.390
thermodynamics, is that it takes
so little information to

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.460
get so much information out.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:42.730
So little data to get a lot of
predictive information out.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:51.200
As we're going on with our
definitions, we can summarize

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.360
a lot of these definitions into
a notation, a chemical

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.220
notation that that will
be very important.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.440
So, for instance, if I'm talking
about three moles of

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.600
hydrogen, at one bar 100
degrees Celsius.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.190
I'm not going to write, given
three moles of hydrogen at one

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.210
bar and three degrees,
blah, blah, blah.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.270
I'm going to write it in
a compact notation.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.240
I'm going to write it like this:
three moles of hydrogen

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:28.090
which is a gas, one bar
100 degrees Celsius.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.210
This notation gives you
everything you need to know

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.590
about the system.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.320
It tells you the number
of moles.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.320
It tells you the phase.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.810
It tells you what kind of
molecule it is, and gives you

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.090
two variables that are
state variables.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.250
You could have the volume
and the temperature.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.120
You could have the volume
and the pressure.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.720
But this tells you everything.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.120
I don't need to write
it down in words.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.270
And then if I want to tell you
about a change of state, or

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:57.360
let's first start
with a mixture.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.400
Suppose that I give to a
mixture like, this is a

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.000
homogeneous system with two
components, like five moles of

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.870
H2O, which is a liquid, at one
bar 25 degrees Celsius, plus

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:23.030
five moles of CH3, CH2, OH,
which is a liquid, and one bar

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.460
at 25 degrees Celsius.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.340
This describes roughly something
that is fairly

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:36.460
commonplace, it's 100-proof
vodka 1/2 water, 1/2 ethanol

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:41.980
-- that describes that
macroscopic system.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.960
You're missing all the
impurities, all the little the

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.870
flavor molecules that go into
it, but basically, that's the

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.790
homogeneous system we were
describing, two component

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.020
homogeneous systems.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.090
Then you can do all sorts
of predictive

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.910
stuff with that system.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.740
All right, that's the
equilibrium system.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.560
Now we want to show a notation,
how do we go from

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.560
one equilibrium state like
this describes to another

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:16.360
equilibrium state?

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.150
So, we take our two equilibrium
states, and you

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:24.450
just put an equal sign between
them, and the equal sign means

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.420
go from one to the other.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:31.470
So, if we took our three moles
of hydrogen, which is a gas at

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:38.150
five bar and 100 degrees
Celsius, and, which is a nice

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.190
equilibrium state here, and we
say now we're going to change

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.080
the equilibrium state to
something new, we're going to

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:48.430
do an expansion, let's say.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.265
We're going to drop the
pressure, the volume

00:27:50.265 --> 00:27:51.440
is going to go up.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.670
I don't need to tell you the
volume here, because you've

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.500
got enough information to
calculate the volume.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.770
The number of moles stays the
same, a closed systems, gas

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.500
doesn't come out.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.710
Stays a gas, but now the
pressure is less, the

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:06.510
temperature is less.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.680
I've done some sort of
expansion on this.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.410
I've gone from 1 equilibrium
state to another equilibrium

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.360
state, and the equal sign means
you go from this state

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.090
to that state.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.420
It's not a chemical reaction.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.270
That's why we don't have an
arrow here, because we could

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.240
go back, this way too.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.510
We can go back and forth
between these

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.070
two equilibrium states.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.860
They're connected.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.210
This means they're connected.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.750
And when I put this,
I have to tell you

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.210
how they are connected.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.310
I have to tell you the
path, if you're

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.270
going to solve a problem.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.030
For instance, you want to know
how much energy you're going

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.260
to get out from doing
this expansion.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.205
How much energy are you going
to get out, and how far are

00:28:42.205 --> 00:28:44.610
you going to be able to drive
a car with this expansion,

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.540
let's say, so that's
the problem.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.640
So, I need to tell you how
you're doing the expansion,

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.290
because that's going to tell
you how much energy you're

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.200
wasting during that expansion.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.420
It goes back to the
second law.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.210
Nothing is efficient.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.220
You're always wasting energy
into heat somewhere when you

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.200
do a change that involves
a mechanical change.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.250
All right, so I need to tell you
the path, when I go from

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.550
one state to the other.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.200
And the path is going to be
the sequence, intermediate

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.140
states going from the initial
state the final state.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:22.670
So, for instance, if I draw a
graph of pressure on one axis

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:27.690
and temperature on the other
axis, my initial state is at a

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:34.950
temperature of 100 degrees
Celsius and five bar.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:42.970
My final stage is 50 degrees
Celsius and one bar.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.120
So, I could have two
steps in my path.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.590
I could decide first of all to
keep the pressure constant and

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.780
lower the pressure.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.880
When I get to 50 degrees
Celsius, I could choose to

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.050
keep the temperature constant
and lower the pressure.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.340
I'm sorry, my first step would
be to keep the pressure

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.340
constant and lower the
temperature, then I lower the

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.200
pressure, keeping the
temperature constant.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.890
So there's my intermediate
state there.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.700
This is one of many paths.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.660
There's an infinite number
of paths you could take.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.490
You could take a continuous
path, where you have an

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:24.170
infinite number of equilibrium
points in between the two, a

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.840
smooth path, where you drop
the pressure and the

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.600
temperature simultaneously
in little increments.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:36.000
All right, so when you do a
problem, the path is going to

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.470
turn out to be extremely
important.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.830
How do you get from
the initial state

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.580
to the final state?

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.770
Define the initial state.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:45.870
Define the final state.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.380
Define the path.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.990
Get all of these really clear,
and you've basically solved

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.420
the problem.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.900
You've got to spend the time to
make sure that everything

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.180
is well defined before
you start trying to

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.440
work out these problem.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.020
More about the path.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.500
There are a couple ways you
could go through that path.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.830
If I look at this smooth
path here.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.955
I could have that path be very
slow and steady, so that at

00:31:14.955 --> 00:31:18.320
every point along the way,
my gas is an equilibrium.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.730
So I've got, this piston here
is compressed, and I slowly,

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.150
slowly increase the volume,
drop the temperature.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.910
Then I can go back, the gas
is included at every

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:33.220
point of the way.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.120
That's a reversible path.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.220
That can reverse the process.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.110
I expand it, and reverse
it, no problem.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:49.740
So, I could have a reversible
path, or I take my gas, and

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.840
instead of slowly, slowly
raising it, dropping the

00:31:53.840 --> 00:32:00.430
pressure, I go from five bar
to one bar extremely fast.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.900
What happens to my gas inside?

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.590
Well, my gas inside is going
to be very unhappy.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:06.800
It's not going stay
in equilibrium.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.940
Parts of the system are going
to be at five bar.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.640
Parts of it at one bar.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.270
Parts of it may be even at zero
bar, if I go really fast.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.910
I'm going to create a vacuum.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:21.780
So the system will not be
described by a single state

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.480
variable during the path.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.700
If I look at different points
in my container during that

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.250
path, I'm going to have to use
a different value of pressure

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.800
or different value of
temperature at different

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.080
points of the container.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.700
That's not an equilibrium state,
and that process turns

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.140
out then to be in irreversible
process.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.410
Do it very quickly.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:46.440
Now to reverse it and get back
to the initial point is going

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.510
to require some input from
outside, like heat or extra

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.320
work or extra heat or something,
because you've done

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.850
an irreversible process.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:33:04.810
You've wasted a lot of energy
in doing that process.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:09.720
I have to tell you whether
the path is reversible or

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.580
irreversible, and the
irreversible path also defines

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.100
the direction of time.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.000
You can only have an
irreversible path go one way

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.750
in time, not the other way.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.070
Chalk breaks irreversibly
and you can't put it

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.590
back together so easily.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:29.000
You've got to pretty much take
that chalk, and make a slurry

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.270
out of it, put water, and dry it
back up, put in a mold, and

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.570
then you can have the chalk
again, but you can't just glue

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:35.480
it back together.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.970
That would not be the
same state as what

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.990
you started out with.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:42.280
And then there are a
bunch of words that

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.820
describe these paths.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.750
Words like adiabatic, which
we'll be very familiar with.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.290
Adiabatic means that there's
no heat transferred between

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.950
the system and the
surrounding.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.520
The boundary is impervious
to transfer of

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.580
heat, like a thermos.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.800
Anything that happens inside of
the thermos is an adiabatic

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.220
change because the thermos has
no connection in terms of

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.560
energy to the outside world.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.940
There's no heat that
can go through the

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.530
walls of the thermos.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.760
Whereas, like isobaric means
constant pressure.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:16.000
So, this path right here from
this top red path is an

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.380
isobaric process.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.685
Constant temperature means
isothermal, so this part means

00:34:21.685 --> 00:34:23.250
an isothermal process.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:28.580
So then, going from the initial
to final states with a

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.160
red path, you start with an
isobaric process and then you

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.260
end with an isothermal
process.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.570
And these are words that are
very meaningful when you read

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:42.650
the text of a problem
or of a process.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.750
Any questions before we
got to the zeroth law?

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:49.230
We're pretty much done with
our definitions here.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.690
Yes.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.040
STUDENT: Was adiabatic
reversible?

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.490
PROFESSOR: Adiabatic can be
either reversible or not, and

00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:57.510
we're going to do that probably

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:01.240
next time or two times.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.110
Any other questions?

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:06.440
Yes.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.390
STUDENT: Is there a boundary
between reversible and

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.780
irreversible?

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.520
PROFESSOR: A boundary between
reversible and irreversible?

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.930
Like something is almost
reversible and almost

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.040
irreversible.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.370
No, pretty much things are
either reversible or

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.490
irreversible.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.520
Now, in practice, it
depends on how good

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.950
your measurement is.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:35.400
And probably also in practice,
nothing is truly reversible.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:43.650
So, it depends on your
error bar in a sense.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.240
It depends on what what you
define, exactly what you

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.470
define in your system.

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:50.230
It becomes a gray area, but it
should be pretty clear if you

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:57.720
can treat something is
reversible are irreversible.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:03.970
Other questions, It's
a good question.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:06.820
So the zeroth law we're going
to go through the laws now.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:11.730
The zeroth law talks about
defining temperature and it's

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:12.440
the common-sense law.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.030
You all know how.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.640
When something hot, it's got a
higher temperature than when

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.320
something is cold.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.860
But it's important to define
that, and define something

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.830
that's a thermometer.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.820
So what do you know?

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.180
What's the empirical
information

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.620
that everybody knows?

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:34.132
Everybody knows that if you take
something which is hot

00:36:34.132 --> 00:36:40.140
and something which is cold, and
you bring them together,

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:47.900
make them touch, that heat is
going to flow from the hot to

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:54.280
the cold, and make them
touch, and heat

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.310
flows from hot to cold.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.200
That's common sense.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:03.150
This is part of your DNA, And
then their final product is an

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:10.830
object, a b which ends up at
a temperature or a warmness

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.070
which is in between the
hot and the cold.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.270
So, this turns out to be warm.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.280
You get your new equilibrium
state, which is in between

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:28.230
what this was, and what
a and b were.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:34.530
Then how do you know that it's
changed temperature, or that

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:37.710
heat has flowed from a to b?

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:41.070
Practically speaking, you need
some sort of property that's

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.030
changing as heat is flowing.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:50.420
For instance, if a were
metallic, you could measure

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:55.460
the connectivity of a or
resistivity, and as heat flows

00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:01.870
out of a into b, the resistivity
of a would change.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:04.520
Or you could have something
that's color metric that

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:09.710
changes color when it's colder,
so you could see the

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:13.840
heat flowing as a changes color
or b changes color as

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.130
heat flows into b.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:17.470
So, you need some sort of
property, something you can

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:21.130
see, something you can measure,
that tells you that

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:21.880
heat has flowed.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.315
Now, if you have three objects,
if you have a, b, and

00:38:25.315 --> 00:38:35.960
c, and you bring them together,
and a is the

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.600
hottest, b is the medium one,
and c is the coldest, so from

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.150
hottest to coldest a, b, c, --
if you bring them together and

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:53.300
make them touch, you know,
intuitively, that heat will

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:57.900
not flow like this.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.650
You know that's not
going to happen.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.730
You know that what will happen
is that heat will flow from a

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:07.530
to b from b to c and
from a to c.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:08.340
That's common-sense.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.090
You know that.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.170
And the other way in the circle
will never happen.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.150
That would that would give rise
to a perpetual motion

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.030
machine, breaking of
the second law.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:22.060
It can't happen.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.500
But that's an empirical
observation, that heat flows

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.100
in this direction.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.380
And that's the zeroth
law thermodynamic.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.090
It's pretty simple.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:38.900
The zeroth law says that if a
and b -- it doesn't exactly

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.660
say that, but it implies this.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.230
It says that if a and b are in
thermal equilibrium, if these

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.060
two are in thermal equilibrium,
meaning that

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.890
there's no heat flows between
them, so that's the definition

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.210
of thermal equilibrium, that
no heat flows between them,

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:56.685
and these two are in thermal
equilibrium, and these two are

00:39:56.685 --> 00:40:02.380
in thermal equilibrium, then
a and c will be also be in

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.910
thermal equilibrium.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.030
But if there's no heat flowing
between these two, and no heat

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.610
flowing between these two,
then you can't have heat

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:13.010
flowing between these two.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.920
So if I get rid of these
arrows, there's no heat

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.510
flowing because they're in
thermal equilibrium, then I

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.640
can't have an arrow here.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.505
That's what the zeroth
law says.

00:40:22.505 --> 00:40:24.610
They're all the same
temperature.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:25.260
That's what it says.

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.530
If two object are in the same
temperature, and two other

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.610
object are in the same
temperature, then all three

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.610
must have the same
temperature.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:37.680
It sounds pretty silly, but it's
really important because

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:44.020
it allows you to define a
thermometer and temperature.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.790
Because now you can say, all
right, well, now b can be my

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:49.340
thermometer.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:54.290
I have two objects, I have an
object which is in Madagascar

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:59.140
and an object which is in
Boston, and I want to know,

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.920
are they the same temperature?

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.040
So I come out with a third
object, b, I go to Madagascar,

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.570
and put b in contact with a.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:11.240
Then I insulate everything, you
know, take it away and see

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.640
if there's any heat flow.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.370
Let's say there's
no heat flow.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.515
Then I insulate it, get back on
the plane to Boston, and go

00:41:18.515 --> 00:41:20.010
back and touch b with c.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:22.680
If there's no heat flow between
the b and c, then I

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.280
can say all right, a and c were
the same temperature.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.440
B is my thermometer that tells
me that a and c are in the

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.180
same temperature.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.165
And there's a certain property
associated with heat flow with

00:41:33.165 --> 00:41:35.860
b, and it didn't change.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.490
And that property
could be color.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:38.300
It could be resistivity.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.390
It could be a lot of
different things.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.320
It could be volume.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.950
And the temperature then is
associated with that property.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.380
And if it had changed, then the
temperature between those

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.830
two would have changed in
a very particular way.

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:57.700
So, zeroth law, then, allows you
to define the concept of

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:05.510
temperature and the measurement
of temperature

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:09.000
through a thermometer.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.010
Let's very briefly go
through stuff that

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:13.210
you've learned before.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:16.180
So, now you have this object
which is going to tell you

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.540
whether other things are in
thermal equilibrium now.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.980
What do you need for
that object?

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:27.840
You need that object to be a
substance, to be something.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:31.630
So, the active part of the
thermometer could be water.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:35.900
It could be alcohol, mercury, it
could be a piece of metal.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.210
You need a substance, and then
that substance has to have a

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.560
property that changes depending
on the heat flow,

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.820
i.e., depending on whether it's
sensing that it's the

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.270
same temperature or different
temperature

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.930
than something else.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:51.790
And that property could be the
volume, like if you have a

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.160
mercury thermometer, the
volume of the mercury.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.090
It could be temperature.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:58.670
It could be resistivity, if
you have a thermocouple.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:02.980
It could be the pressure.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.110
All right, so now you
have an object.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.000
You've got a property
that changes,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.180
depending on the heat flow.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.280
It's going to tell you about
the temperature.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.220
Now you need to define the
temperature scales.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:16.190
So, you need some reference
points to be able to tell you,

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:22.860
OK, this temperature is 550
degrees Smith, whatever.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:27.380
So, you assign values to very
specific states of matter and

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.610
call those the reference points
for your temperature.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:32.840
For instance, freezing of water
or boiling of water, the

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.610
standard ones.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.150
And then an interpolation
scheme.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:41.050
You need a functional form that
connects the value at one

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:45.240
state of matter, the freezing
point of water, to another

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.440
phase change, the boiling
point of water.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.420
You can choose a linear
interpolation or quadratic,

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.610
but you've got to choose it.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.140
And it turns out not
to be so easy.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.630
And if you go back into the
1800's when thermodynamics was

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:02.680
starting, there were a zillion
different temperatures scales.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.620
Everybody had their own favorite
temperature scales.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.550
The one that we're most
familiar with is the

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:11.190
centigrade or Celsius scale
where mercury was the

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:13.970
substance, and the volume of
mercury is the property.

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:16.510
The reference points are water,
freezing or boiling,

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:19.180
and the interpolation is linear,
and then that morphed

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.940
into the Kelvin scale, as we're
going to see later.

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.070
The Fahrenheit scale is
an interesting scale.

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:26.130
It turns out the U.S. and
Jamaica are the only two

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.670
places on Earth now that use
the Fahrenheit scale.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:33.800
Mr. Fahrenheit, Daniel Gabriel
Fahrenheit was a German

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.890
instrument maker.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.600
The way he came up with his
scale was actually he borrowed

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.810
the Romer scale, which
came beforehand.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:47.990
The Romer scale was, Romer was
a Dane, and he defined

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:53.900
freezing of water at 7.5 degrees
Roemer, and 22.5

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.480
degrees Romer as blood-warm.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.180
That was his definition.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.510
Two substances, blood
and water.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.160
Two reference points, freezing
and blood-warm, you know, the

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.190
human body.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:09.760
A linear interpolation between
the two, and then some numbers

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.660
associated with them,
7-1/2 and 22-1/2.

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.960
Why does he choose 7-1/2 as the
freezing point of water?

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.290
Because he thought that would be
big enough that in Denmark,

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:22.560
the temperature wouldn't
go below zero.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.140
That's how he picked 7-1/2.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.900
Why not?

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.480
He didn't want to use negative
numbers to measure temperature

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.130
in Denmark outside.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:32.740
Well, Fahrenheit came along and
thought, well, you know,

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.340
7-1/2, that's kind of silly;
22-1/2 that's, kind of silly.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:40.160
So let's multiply everything
by four.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:46.390
I think it becomes 30 degrees
for the freezing of water and

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:49.860
22.5 x 4, which I don't know
what it is, 100 or something

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:55.480
-- no, it's 90 I think.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.040
And then for some reason, that
nobody understands, he decided

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:04.200
to multiply again by 16/15, and
that's how we get 32 for

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.340
freezing of water and 96 in his
words for the temperature

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.190
in the mouth or underneath
the armpit of a

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:12.390
living man in good health.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:14.170
What a great temperature
scale.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:16.630
It turns out that 96
wasn't quite right.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:21.110
Then he interpolated and found
out water boils at 212.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:23.920
But, you know, his experiment
wasn't so great, and, you

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.790
know, maybe had a fever when
he did the reference point

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:28.720
with 96, whatever.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.290
It turns out that it's not 96
to be in good health, it's

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:34.120
98.6 -- whatever.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.760
That's how we got to the
Fahrenheit scale.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.090
All right, next time we're going
to talk about a much

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.330
better scale, which is the ideal
gas thermometer and how

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:45.380
we get to the Kelvin scale.
