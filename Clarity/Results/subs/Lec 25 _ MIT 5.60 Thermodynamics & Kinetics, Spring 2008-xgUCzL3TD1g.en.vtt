00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.020
PROFESSOR: So, last time we
started in on a discussion of

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.650
a new topic, with was
statistical mechanics.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.730
So what we're trying to do now
is revisit the thermodynamics

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.850
that we've spent most of the
term deriving and trying to

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.860
use in a microscopic approach.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.200
So our hope is to be able to
start with a microscopic model

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.930
of matter, starting with atoms
and molecules that we

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.360
know are out there.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.850
And formulate thermodynamics
starting from that microscopic

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.650
point of view.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.940
In contrast to the way it was
first formulated historically,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.020
and the way we've presented it
also, which is as an entirely

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.930
empirical subject based on
macroscopic observation and

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.090
deduction from that.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.830
So, we looked at the
probabilities that states with

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.310
different energies would be
occupied and we inferred that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.120
there would be a simple way to
describe the distribution of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.830
atoms or molecules in states
of different levels.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.130
First of all, although I didn't
state it explicitly,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.420
essentially assumed there is
that if I've got a bunch of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.740
molecules, and I've got states
that they could be in of equal

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.330
energy, then the probability
that they would be in one or

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.390
another of those states
is the same.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.770
If the energies of the states
are equal, the probabilities

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.630
that those states will
be occupied.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.170
That they'll be populated by
molecules, will be equal.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.070
And then we deduced what's
called the Boltzmann

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:07.850
probability distribution.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.540
Which says that the probability
that a molecular

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:28.770
state, i, will be occupied is
proportional to e to the minus

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.770
Ei over kT, where little
Ei is the energy of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.560
that molecular state.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.310
And then realizing that the
probability that some state

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.430
out there has to be occupied,
we saw that of course if we

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.220
sum over all these probabilities
that sum has to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.350
equal one, right?

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.560
In other words, the sum
over all of i of P of

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.340
i is equal to one.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.250
So that means that we could
write not just that this is

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.730
proportional to this, but we
could write that Pi is equal

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.200
to e to the minus Ei over
kT divided by the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.890
sum of all such terms.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.140
So now we know how to figure
out how likely it is that a

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.430
certain state is occupied.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.690
And what it means is, let's say
we have a whole bunch of

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.560
states whose energy is pretty
low compared to kT. kT, the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.030
Boltzmann constant times
temperature is energy units.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.800
So if it's pretty warm, maybe
it's room temperature, maybe

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.910
it's warmer.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.350
And there are a whole lot of
states that are accessible

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.840
because the energies
are less than kT.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.960
What does that mean?

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.660
That means that you could put a
bunch of different i's here

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.810
whose energies are all quite
low compared to kT.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.090
And they'll all have significant
probabilities.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.680
Now let's decrease the energy.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.170
Go to cold temperature.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.970
So kT becomes really small.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.070
So that e to the minus energy
over kT starts to, if this

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.220
gets to be bigger than kT by a
lot, then this whole thing is

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.700
a very small number.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.600
Suddenly, you get very few
states accessible.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.200
So if we just plot this
distribution, of course it's

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.780
easy to do, it's just a
decaying exponential.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.710
So Pi, which is a
function of Ei.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:56.780
It just looks like this.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.520
And here are a bunch
of states.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.590
And if we have a classical
mechanics picture of matter,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.290
then there would just be
continuous states.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.440
And if we have a quantum
mechanical picture of matter,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.000
there might be individual states
with gaps in between

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.780
the energies.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.260
Either way, what happens, what
this is saying is, if we go

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.940
out to higher and higher
energies, then you have a

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.630
smaller and smaller probability
to be in

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.640
a state like that.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.650
And if you go to low energies,
the probability gets bigger.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.850
And it depends on temperature.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.310
Because it's the ratio between
the energy and kT that

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.530
dictates the size
of that term.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:57.860
So let's say this is moderate
temperature.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:07.810
If we go to low temperature, it
might look more like this.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.200
Hardly any states can be
occupied because even states

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.490
of rather moderate energies,
suddenly now those energies

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.090
are much bigger than kT.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.420
In other words, kT is measuring
thermal energy.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.500
It's saying there's not enough
thermal energy to populate, to

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.390
knock things into states
whose energy is

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.940
much higher than that.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.400
So you have a very precipitous
decay.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.490
If you go to the other
extreme, of very high

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:47.200
temperature, then this will
tend to flatten out.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.640
Eventually it'll decay, but
it may take a long time.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.410
Because now kT is enormous.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.740
So the energy has to
get to be very big.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.940
Before it's bigger than kT.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.590
And as long as it
isn't, then this

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.990
exponential term is not small.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.950
So there be a whole bunch of
states that may be occupied.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.850
In other words, a whole bunch
of states that are thermally

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.820
accessible at equilibrium.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.300
Systems at thermal equilibrium,
molecules are

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.990
getting knocked around
with whatever

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.400
thermal energy is available.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.990
Crashing into each other or into
the walls of a vessel.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.790
And there'll be a distribution
of molecular energies.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.340
And that distribution is skewed
either low or high

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.710
depending on the temperature.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.330
So that's what that
distribution, the Boltzmann

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.970
distribution, is telling us.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.870
This is often called a Boltzmann
factor, because it's

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:53.460
telling what the population of
some particular state is.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.580
OK.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.980
Now, this is just dealing with
individual molecule states.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.660
Then we said, OK, what about
the whole system?

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.880
Well, the same kind of relation
holds there, too.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.260
In other words, if these are
individual molecule energies,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:29.240
now if I look at the entire
system, right well, still,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.850
there's no reason that same
distribution doesn't hold.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.140
And it does.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:44.800
So in other words, Pi of Ei,
that's the whole system

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:55.870
energy, is e to the minus Ei
over kT, over the sum over i,

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.920
Ei over kT.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.920
Now, this i doesn't refer to
a single molecule state.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.920
We're talking about
a whole system.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.820
It might be a mole of atoms or
molecules in the gas phase, or

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.020
what have you.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.170
It refers to a system state
where the energy, the state of

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:19.370
every one of those atoms or
molecules is specified.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:30.650
So this is a system
microstate.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:40.990
Every molecular state
is specified.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.920
So for a mole of stuff, that
means there might be 10 to the

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:51.680
24 or so molecular states that
this single subscript is

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.770
indicating.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.640
But the point is, those
states exist.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.050
They have a total energy.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.530
What's the probability that the
whole system will be in

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.400
such a state?

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:12.750
Still going to be proportional
to the total system energy.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:30.170
It turns out that these
summations end up taking on an

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.240
enormous importance in
statistical mechanics.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.990
And the reason is, as we'll see
shortly, it turns out that

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.660
every single macroscopic
thermodynamic function can be

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.260
derived by knowing just that.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:51.330
Just these sums, what are called
partition functions.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.050
So of course they take on
enormous importance.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:11:05.540
So, we call them partition
functions because what they're

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.620
doing is, they're indicating
how the molecules are

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.550
partitioned among the different
available levels.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.280
The molecules or
a whole system.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:37.850
So the molecular partition
function is labeled little q.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:47.230
And the system partition
function is labeled big Q.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:59.740
It's called the canonical
partition function.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.910
And because they are going
to take on such special

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:11.450
importance, let's just look at
some of their properties for

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:18.210
different kinds of systems
and in general.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:24.000
OK, first of all, let's talk
about units and values.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.370
They are unitless.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.240
This is an exponential
function.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.680
Here are units of energy
and energy.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.110
But this is a unitless
was number.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.970
It's just some number, right?

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:34.860
Could be 1.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.700
Could be 10.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.210
Could be 50.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.700
Whatever, right?

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.420
Could be 10 to the 24.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:49.150
Its magnitude tells you about
more or less how many states

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.310
are thermally accessible.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.500
Because, look at it.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.710
And then go back to the example
that I showed you if

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:01.300
lots of these terms are big, are
significant because this

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.960
is really a big number, right?

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.650
It's really hot.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.300
So lots of states have energies
lower than kT, which

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.420
means this is not too small, for
lots and lots of values of

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.910
i, then this just
keeps adding up.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.230
And of course, same here.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.020
So the number might
be very large.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.420
But if we're in the low
temperature limit, maybe we're

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:27.960
in such low temperature that
only the lowest possible state

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.460
is occupied.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.780
And everything else,
it's just too cold.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.990
There's not enough thermal
energy to occupy anything but

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.200
the very lowest state
available.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.520
Well, in that case the lowest
state, this would be one.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.340
Essentially we could
label this zero.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.460
We could put the energy, the
zero of energy there.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.370
Everything else is really big
compared to kT, which means

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.120
this exponential gets to be a
really small number for every

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.510
state except one.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.350
And this is just equal to one.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:59.510
In other words, the magnitude
of these numbers tells us

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.820
about how many states are
accessible, thermally

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:09.410
accessible, to molecules
or to a whole system.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.970
So let's just go through a
couple of specific examples to

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:19.490
try to make that a little
more concrete.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.900
One is, let's start in
the simplest case.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.470
Which it'll turn out
I just alluded to.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:29.130
Let's consider a perfect atomic
crystal at essentially

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:40.310
zero degrees Kelvin.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.940
Zero Kelvin.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.990
So every atom.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.130
Or even if it's a molecular
crystal, every molecule,

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.230
they're all in the
ground state.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.190
There's no excess
thermal energy.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.380
Every molecule is in
its proper place.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.570
Every atom, if it's
an atomic lattice.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.990
In other words, it's in
the ground state.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.910
That's it.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.490
So again, we can place the
zero where we like.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.030
We'll place it there.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.490
That one, for that one state,
this will be equal to one.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:25.110
And for everything else
it'll be zero.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:33.800
So Q is just the sum of e
to the minus Ei over kT.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:40.420
It's equal to e to the minus
zero over kT plus e to the

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:47.790
minus E1 over kT plus e to
the minus E2 over kT.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.770
But remember, T is
really tiny.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.870
It's almost zero
degrees Kelvin.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:57.180
So all these things are
much bigger than that.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.160
So this is vanishingly small.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.360
This is vanishingly small.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.900
The whole thing is approximately
equal to one.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.290
That's it.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:13.890
Also, if we say OK, now what's
the probability of the system

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.280
being in a particular state.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:21.220
Well, we have an expression
for that.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.810
So let's look at P0.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:33.260
It's e to the minus E0
over kT over the sum.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:42.180
Which we've just seen.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.840
So it's e to the minus E0 over
to kT divided by e to the

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:57.110
minus E0 over kT plus e to the
minus E1 over kT, and so on.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.270
This is the only term
that's significant.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.470
So it's approximately
equal to one.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.670
Now, while I've got this written
here, let's just make

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.370
sure we've got something
clear.

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:12.560
What if we hadn't arbitrarily
set the zero of

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.360
energy equal to zero?

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.790
I mean, it's arbitrary, right?

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.600
We can put the zero of
energy anywhere.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.240
And you might think, well, gee
that's going to have a big

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.070
effect on everything.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:25.560
Well, it would have an effect
on the actual number that we

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.700
get for Q. But what you'll see
is that any measurable

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.000
quantity that we calculate
won't be affected.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.480
It's only the zero of the energy
scale that's going to

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.480
be affected.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.260
So for example, let's look
at this probability.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.030
It doesn't matter where we
put the zero of energy.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.300
This term is still going
to be enormously bigger

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.560
then the next one.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.280
And the next one.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.560
And the next one.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.310
So in this sum only this term
is going to matter.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.190
It's going to cancel
with this term.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.630
So whether or not these
individual terms are equal to

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.650
one, which happens if we set
this to zero, or whether

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.480
they're equal to some
other number.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.330
Still, the probability that the
system is in the lowest

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.150
state is one, right?

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.770
That doesn't depend on where we
arbitrarily put the zero of

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.010
the energy scale.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.240
The state is still going to
be in the ground state, at

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.440
essentially zero
degrees Kelvin.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.750
And it'll turn out to be that
way with any property that we

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.580
can measure.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.450
Only the zero of this scale
moves if we arbitrarily move

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.800
it somewhere.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.945
But the observable, measurable
quantities that we calculate,

00:18:36.945 --> 00:18:38.010
they won't change.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:41.610
Other than that scale.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:47.520
So that's one simple example.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.260
Now let's look at
another example.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.220
Let's consider a mole of atoms,
roaming around in the

00:18:53.220 --> 00:19:06.860
gas phase at room temperature.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.240
OK, so now what I want to do
is just have a simple model

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.150
for their translational
motion.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.380
And of course, we could
do that either quantum

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.390
mechanically or classically
solve for that.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.240
We're going to use an
even simpler model.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.780
And this model is going to be
very, very useful for a lot of

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.580
the things that we'll treat.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.830
It's called a lattice model.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.300
All it means is, we're
going to divide up

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.620
the available volume.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.870
This room, for example,
into zillions

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.250
of tiny little elements.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.280
Little volume elements.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.770
Each one about the
size of an atom.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.610
The idea being, we're going to
specify the state of the atom

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.560
by saying where is it.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.690
Is it in this lattice sight,
in this one, in this

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.520
one, in this one.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:11.670
So it's a lattice model.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.910
Might be an atom there.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:19.190
Might be one there.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.650
So we're going to divide
the volume up.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:37.880
So let's call our atomic volume
little v. Our total

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:43.720
volume big V. And an atomic
volume, it's going to be on

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.110
the order of 1 angstroms
cubed.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:52.540
Or 10 to the minus
30 meters cubed.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.850
And our room, our volume
macroscopic one, might be on

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.380
the order of one meter cubed.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.420
Ordinary sort of size.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:09.730
So now let's figure out our
molecular partition function.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.260
Now, implicit in this, we're
basically saying that the

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.280
energy, the translational
energy, is basically zero.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.070
In other words, all these states
have the same energy.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.380
They're just located in
different positions.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.520
At any given instant of time.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.140
And what that means is all
these terms, all these

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.350
Boltzmann factors, we just
set them equal to one.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.940
We'll set the zero of energy
there, be done with it.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.260
It's a simple model.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.460
But it's going to give us the
right order of magnitude that

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.860
we're after.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:45.490
So, how many states are there
that are accessible?

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:50.950
Well, on the order of 10
to the 30th, right?

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:57.490
So q, little q, we'll call it
little q translational, it's

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:02.520
just discussing where
things are.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.230
Is on the order of
10 to the 30th.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:09.000
And if we do a more careful
treatment, if we treat the

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.010
translational energy of atoms,
either classically or quantum

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.870
mechanically and solve it.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.770
We'll still get, we still
do get, about the

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:20.850
same order of magnitude.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.610
Now let's treat the
whole system.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.890
So, what happens?

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.930
What are our total
possible states?

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.940
Because we have to add this up
for every possible state.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.720
Well, let's start with
the first atom.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.990
It has to be somewhere.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.990
It has 10 to the 30th
possibilities for

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.810
where it can be.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.940
Let's start with the
second atom.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.110
And put it somewhere.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.840
Well, it has 10 to the 30th
minus one, which is still

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.190
pretty close to 10
to the 30th.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.170
Let's let's go to
the third atom.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.870
And the fourth.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.220
If we have about a mole of
atoms, let's say 10 to the

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.480
24th atoms, that's still going
to occupy a very small

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.790
fraction of the site.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.430
Only one in a million.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.530
So we don't have to keep
careful track.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.030
Every one of them, we can just
say, look, there are 10 to the

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:11.370
30th available sites.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.120
Because we're not going to worry
about a change in one in

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.340
a millionth.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:24.860
So what that means is, capital
Q, trans for the system, is 10

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.620
to the 30th times
10 to the 30th.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.900
In other words, let's now
take the whole state.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.260
Well, I could put
atom one here.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.120
I have 10 to the 30th
possibilities.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.620
Atom two, I can put
anywhere else.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.640
So the joint probability of
that particular state, for

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.270
just the two atoms, is 10th to
the 30th times 10 to the 30th.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.750
It's 10 to the 30th squared.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:56.470
So this is going
to keep going.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.780
It's going to be 10 to the
30th to the Nth power.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.660
Where N is the number
of atoms, which

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.060
is 10 of the 24th.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.860
Huge number, right?

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.840
It is a huge number.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.840
And that, too, if we treat the
whole thing classically or

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.090
quantum mechanically and
work it all out.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.200
We'll get that number.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.790
Or something on that order.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.000
Because you know there really
is a simply astronomical

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.890
number of states accessible to
the whole bunch of atoms or

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.670
molecules in this room.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.210
It really is that big.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.330
So in other words, capital
Q is just an

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.600
astronomical number.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.080
And it is the case.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.950
OK.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:47.590
There's an important
sort of nuance

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.430
that we need to introduce.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.150
And it's the following.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.880
Turns out, it is an astronomical
number.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.530
But a tiny bit less astronomical
than what I've

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.300
treated so far would indicate.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.300
So let's look a little
more carefully.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:08.910
What I've said is that Q
translational is little q

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.130
translational, that is, that
10 to the 30th number.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.150
To the Nth power.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.220
But there's one failing here.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:23.030
Which is, when I got that, when
I decided that if I have

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.000
just the first two atoms I've
got 10th to the 30th times 10

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.090
to the 30th possible states, the
trouble with that is then

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.830
if I keep counting all the
possible atoms starting with

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:37.980
each one, I'll double-count
it, right?

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.360
In other words, what if I
interchange those two atoms?

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.680
Well, those states are
identical, right?

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.730
Indistinguishable.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:51.700
And it's only distinguishable
states that count.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.550
When you specify these
things, these are

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.140
indicating distinct states.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.560
In some way, at least in

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.020
principle, measurably different.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.150
If the atom's are identical, in
other words, if it's a mole

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:10.810
of the same stuff, I don't have
a way of distinguishing

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.620
between those two.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.080
I have to correct for that.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.050
And when I come to the third
atom, I have to correct for

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.480
all the possible interchanges.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.730
Of course, it's three
factorial.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.230
And in general, it's
N factorial.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.430
So this result needs
to be modified.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:37.330
This is true for distinguishable
particles.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.170
In other words, if I had all
different atoms, so I could

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.980
label them all, then I don't
have that correction.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.570
Because then there's really a
difference between that state

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.400
and the state with the two
atoms interchanged.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.780
But if it's a mole of identical
atoms, that's no

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.580
longer the case.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:58.250
So then, Q translational is
little q translational to the

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:04.190
N power divided by
N factorial.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.370
It's still going to be an
absolutely enormous number.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.560
But it's going to be a little
less absolutely enormous than

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.170
it was a minute ago.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.930
Now finally, I just want
to introduce a handy

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.650
approximation to N factorial
that's going to turn out to be

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.450
very useful again and again.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:31.850
And that's called Stirling's
approximation.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:40.750
For the log of a big number,
ln N factorial is N log N

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:48.670
minus N. If we take e to those,
both sides, then we

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:53.910
find that N factorial is equal
to e to the minus N

00:27:53.910 --> 00:28:02.030
N to the nth power.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:07.160
So this, then, is approximately
equal to q

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:14.980
translational to
the Nth power.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:21.030
Over N to the N times e to the
minus N. Now let's put the

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.910
numbers back in.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:32.280
There's our 10 to the 30th to
the 10 to the 24th power.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.880
And now we're going to diminish
that just a bit.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.090
It's N to the Nth power.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:47.600
So it's 10 to the 24th to the
10 to the 24th power.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:55.350
Times e to the minus 10
to the 24th power.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.040
So, we can cancel
something here.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:05.620
So we have 10 to the 6th to the
10 to the 24th power times

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:14.740
e to the 10 to the 24th
power. e is about 10

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.480
to the 0.4th power.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:23.630
So this whole thing is about 10
to the 6.4th power to the

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:28.590
10 to the 24th power
It's still a

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.850
pretty respectable number.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.920
You could still say
astronomical.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.820
But maybe astronomical,
but not quite to

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.790
the edge of the universe.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.490
Whereas the one before maybe hit
the edge of the universe

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:44.880
and then beyond.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.430
So that's our second example.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.970
And again, part of what I'm
trying to do here is just

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.320
introduce some ideas.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.840
Things like this
way of modeling

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.170
positions and so forth.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.340
But also, again, orders
of magnitude.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.470
How big are these numbers.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.280
For different sorts
of systems.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.660
So let's do one more example.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:07.170
Now, let's consider a
polymer in a liquid.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.760
And it has different
configurations.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.620
And they might be a little
bit different in energy.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.630
For example, some configurations
might bring

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.310
neighboring regions of the
polymer into proximity where

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.280
they could hydrogen bond.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.710
And the point is that then the
molecular energies involved

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.940
will change a little bit.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.790
Because of some sorts of
interactions that are possible

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.180
in some configurations.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:33.410
And not in other
configurations.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:36.360
So what I'm trying to do is
introduce a very simple

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.750
framework through which we
might be able to look at

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:42.880
things like protein folding,
or DNA hydrogen bonding.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.610
Things like this.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.290
And just in a simple way model
how those work and what the

00:30:46.290 --> 00:31:15.950
forces are that drive them.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:22.960
So we'll think about polymer
configurations.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.310
So let's look at a few
configurations.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:33.000
Here is going to be one.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.780
I'm going to label
this one here.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:32:02.750
And then here are
a few others.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.740
So I've labeled them this way
so that you can see how they

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.740
are distinct from each other.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:12.850
This one would have a possible
interaction.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.690
So we'll label its energy.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:25.290
So this is molecular state
i, here's going to

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.890
be our energy, Ei.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:33.120
And let's call this one
negative e int, for an

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.600
interaction energy
that's favorable.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:44.490
And these will be zero.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.250
Let's just put that there.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:56.030
Zero, zero, zero.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:01.630
And let's also indicate
the degeneracy.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.890
How many states, different
states are there

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.880
with the same energy.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.830
And that's called gi.

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.650
And here it's one.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:16.560
And here are these three.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.240
So that's the framework
of our model.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.700
Well, so what's our molecular
partition function for this

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.760
configurational degree
of freedom?

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:37.720
Well, we can label it little
q configurational.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:43.920
So we're going to sum over these
states. e to the minus

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:50.950
Ei for the different
configurations over kT.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:57.400
So it's e to the
e int over kT.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.380
Plus three times e to the zero
over kT, we'll get all those

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.770
other three terms.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:05.850
So that's it.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:12.730
It's e to the e int over
kT plus three.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:16.040
Remember, the interaction energy
is negative e int.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:22.640
It's a favorable interaction.
e int is a positive number.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.120
So that's our result.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:32.760
Now we've described the
probabilities in terms of the

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.380
states that can be occupied.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.480
That is, we've added it up.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.000
But of course, even the way
I wrote it just out of

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.250
convenience, I didn't
actually write out

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:41.350
each term in the sum.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:42.860
In the notes I actually
did that.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.620
But of course it's not necessary
to write e to the

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.980
zero over kT plus e to the zero
over kT and write that

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.360
three times for each
of these three.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.330
Rather, it's convenient to
group them together.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:57.190
And the point I'm illustrating
here is that in our

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:02.500
expression, for the partition
function, we've written that

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.060
in terms of the individual
states.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.440
But we doing a sum over the
individual molecular states.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:14.090
But we could also sum
over energy levels.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:17.210
Including the degeneracy.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:21.950
So we could say, let's not do
the sum over every state.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.370
After all, what if there are a
hundred states that had the

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:24.950
same energy.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.830
Rather than just three.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.740
Gets to be kind of
painful, right?

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.230
Instead let's just sum
over energy levels.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.500
They're all going to be the
same factor anyway.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.160
And then we'll have, we'll
just explicitly write the

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.140
degeneracy in there.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:51.380
So, we can write the partition
function as a

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:57.740
sum over energy level.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:06.170
So, in other words q is the
sum over i, e to the

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:11.500
minus Ei over kT.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:22.390
That's individual molecular
states i.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:27.880
But we also could write it as
the sum over i, where this now

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:36.070
is molecular energy levels i.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:40.590
And then we need to incorporate
the degeneracy gi

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:44.380
e to the minus Ei over kT.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.220
Same thing, of course.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.130
But again, sometimes much
more convenient to

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:53.150
write things this way.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:56.760
And of course, we can write
the probabilities of the

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.920
occupancies in the
same way, too.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:07.190
That is, we could talk about the
Pi in terms of individual

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:17.190
states. e to the minus Ei over
kT over q, the whole sum.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:35.650
Or Pi summing over energy
levels, gi e to the minus Ei

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:40.450
over kT, divided by q.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:42.280
Here, of course, this
is bigger if

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.230
it's degenerate, right?

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.010
It's saying that the probability
of being in this

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:49.450
energy level is three times the
probability of it being in

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:53.540
any individual one
of the states.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.410
But sometimes it's useful
to keep track of

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.120
things in this way.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:03.780
What it shows you too is that,
remember when we looked at,

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.760
did I erase it?

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.060
I guess it's gone.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:13.300
When we looked at this
probability distribution for

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:18.550
the occupancies of the levels,
of course, what it says is at

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:22.990
any temperature, the lowest
level is the most probable.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.220
For intermediate temperatures.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:29.730
For low temperatures, for
high temperatures.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.590
At high temperature, it might be
only a little more probable

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.950
than the next one over, and the
next one, and so forth.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.690
But the very lowest state
always has the highest

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:41.040
probability.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.400
But the lowest energy doesn't
always have the highest

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.330
probability because
of degeneracies.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.310
There might be many states
with an energy up here.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:53.020
And the probability of any one
of them is only a little lower

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.700
than the probability of
the lowest energy.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.840
That could be the case here.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.210
Let's say, the interaction
energy

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.610
isn't enormously strong.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:07.090
So there is some energetic
favoring of this state.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.300
Maybe there are 10% at
room temperature.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.420
Maybe it turns out there are 10%
more molecules like this

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.830
than in any one of
these states.

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:18.110
But of course, these three
altogether mean that there are

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:21.310
many more molecules at
this energy than

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:32.620
at the lowest energy.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:37.030
Now of course we could do the
same thing for the canonical

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.880
partition function.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.160
Not just the molecular one.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:58.370
So in other words, capital Q sum
over i system microstates.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:03.300
e to the minus capital
Ei over kT.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:08.350
But we could also write it
as a sum over energies.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:17.300
Sum over system energies.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.390
Ei.

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.950
And then we have to include
the degeneracy.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:35.500
Capital Omega i e to the
minus Ei over kT.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:46.680
Degeneracy of the system
energy Ei.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:54.040
Little g here is the
degeneracy of

00:40:54.040 --> 00:41:03.140
molecular energy Ei.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.970
Now, same form.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.210
Just an important difference,
though.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:12.120
This number, this little gi, is
typically a small number.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.500
It could be one, it
could be a few.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.590
This number is usually
astronomical.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:22.420
That's basically, that is,
what we calculated here.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.220
In other words, how many total
system states are there with a

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.760
particular energy.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.230
Well, in many, many, many
cases the answer is some

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.930
astronomical number.

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:36.130
So this number might often
be between one and ten.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.530
This number might be
10 to the 24th.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:43.230
It might be 10 to the 24th
to a large power.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.940
And, of course, that has a big
effect on the way things end

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.890
up working.

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:51.730
In statistical mechanics
and in thermodynamics.

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:55.650
A lot of thermodynamics results
are the way they are

00:41:55.650 --> 00:42:00.900
because you have so many
possible states with a

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.890
particular energy.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.950
That that energy can be strongly
favored just by

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:09.160
virtue of the number of
states that there are.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.720
Just the way, in a very small
way, this energy might be

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.350
favored just because there are
more states with it then there

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:15.290
are states here.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.610
But again, with the
system, it's not a

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.740
factor of three to one.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:21.340
It might be a factor of
10 to the 24th to

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.740
the power of something.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.760
It might be just enormously
larger than other

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.100
possibilities that'll tend
to put the energy

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:40.500
at a certain place.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.370
And just to continue, of course,
the same thing goes

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:46.930
for the system probabilities.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:52.490
Pi, right, which is e to the
minus Ei over kT divided by

00:42:52.490 --> 00:43:04.180
capital Q. If this is a sum over
states, or omega i e to

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:17.640
the minus Ei over kT over Q,
let's write this over, if now

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.250
we're calculating
the probability

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:25.230
of an energy level.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.360
And it's important to make
the distinction.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:31.560
Because in many cases, that's
what we care about.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.620
What's the energy
of the system?

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.440
And we often don't care about
exactly where's that molecule

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.340
and that one, and that one,
and that one, right?

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:44.060
The individual states that might
be involved that would

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:51.600
comprise that energy.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:57.240
Now, what I want to do is start
deriving thermodynamics.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:01.630
Like I promised, we're going
to be able to derive every

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.590
thermodynamic quantity
if we just know

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.270
the partition function.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.780
So now I just want
to show that that

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:32.020
might really be true.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:43.840
So, the point is that from Q
we're going to get all of our

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.870
thermodynamics.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.670
And let's start with
the energy.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.000
Remember u, right?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.400
That's our system energy.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:45:00.290
It's an average energy.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:04.660
It's an average of the energy
that we would get by looking

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:09.450
at the states that the system
might be occupying.

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:12.660
So we can write it
as a sum over i.

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:17.900
Of Pi times Ei.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.640
In other words, it's going to be
determined by the energy of

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.625
any system state times the
probability that the system is

00:45:23.625 --> 00:45:25.160
in that state.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.910
Add them all up.

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:31.560
Well, we know what that is.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:45.630
It's the sum i of Ei, e to the
minus Ei over kT divided by Q.

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:48.220
Now, I'm going to just make
a simple substitution.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:52.880
I'm going to use the term beta
to mean one over kT.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.000
I'm really just using that so I
don't need to use the chain

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.470
rule a billion times and
doing derivatives.

00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:04.070
So I'm going to write this is
sum over i Ei e to the minus

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:16.920
beta Ei over Q.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.710
So Q, then, in this term is
just a sum over i e to the

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:23.180
minus beta Ei.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.190
So.

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:25.520
Now I do want to take
some derivatives.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:40.310
If I take dQ / d beta, keeping
V and N constant, then I get

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.910
derivative with respect
to beta.

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:47.760
Sum over i e to the
minus beta Ei.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:52.260
So that's going to bring
out Ei, right?

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:57.930
So it's going to bring out minus
Ei minus the sum over i,

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:01.100
Ei e to the minus beta Ei.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.050
That obviously looks
like a handy thing.

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:21.880
Because that looks
like that term.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:29.445
Then, our average energy,
remember, it's one over Q. Sum

00:47:29.445 --> 00:47:34.580
of i, Ei e to the
minus beta Ei.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:45.650
So now, it's just minus one
over q, dQ / d beta.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:53.180
So that's just the same as
minus d log Q / d beta.

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.540
And now I'm going to
use the chain rule.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:11.260
So it's minus d log Q /
dT times dT / d beta.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:18.950
All at constant V and N. Now I
can easily get dT / d beta.

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:25.720
Because d beta / dT is just
minus one over kT squared.

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:30.020
It's just the derivative of one
over kT with respect to T.

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:38.400
So finally, my average E, which
is u, is just kT squared

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:51.070
times d log Q / dT constant
V, N. That's terrific.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:55.950
In other words, if I have an
expression for Q, I know the

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:58.280
partition function, and I
can calculate it at any

00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.790
temperature.

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:02.600
I just need to take log of it,
take its derivative with

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.420
respect to temperature.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:08.460
Multiply it by k T squared
and I've got my energy.

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:16.110
Not very complicated, right?

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:19.610
So in other words, macroscopic
thermodynamic properties come

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:22.490
straight out of our microscopic
model of

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:24.070
statistical mechanics.

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:29.130
Statistical thermodynamics.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:31.620
Now I'm just going to state the
next result, just because

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.320
I want to get there and it'll be
followed up more next time.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.830
But it's the following.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:42.550
You can see, of course, our Q
is a function of V and N and

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:44.470
T. It's a function of V because
in principle the

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.790
energies that are going
into all this can be

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:50.530
a function of volume.

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:53.970
What thermodynamic function
is naturally a

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:55.660
function of N, V, T?

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.350
Who remembers?

00:49:58.350 --> 00:49:59.650
Gibbs free energy?

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:05.460
Helmholtz free energy?

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.700
Enthalpy?

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.640
Which one?

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.660
Nobody knows.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:18.640
What's a function of N, V, and
T. Or, V and T, is what we

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.000
really formulate it as.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.060
N was introduced later.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.190
The Helmholtz free energy.

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:26.470
Thank you.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:29.600
What that suggests is that
actually the simplest and most

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.930
natural connection between Q and
macroscopic thermodynamics

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.050
is to the Helmholtz
free energy.

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:40.860
And the result that you'll see
derived next time is A is just

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:51.120
minus kT log of Q. What
a simple result.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.770
And you'll see the derivations
in your notes.

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.670
You can see it's a couple
of lines, right?

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:58.490
But of course, if you know A,
and you know E, you know

00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:59.230
everything, right?

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:00.960
Because S is in there.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:06.330
And then other combinations
can give S and G and mu.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:07.110
And p.

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:08.900
And anything else you want.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.330
So that's the point, is that
all of macroscopic

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:12.560
thermodynamics follows.

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.690
And you'll see that elaborated
more next time.

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:20.430
And in addition, a very simple
natural expression for the

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:24.470
entropy in terms of the states
available follows, that we've

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:25.410
alluded to before.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:26.880
And now you'll see
it played out.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.130
Right.
