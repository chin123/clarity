00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.240
PROFESSOR: Last time, under the
tutelage of Professor Blendi,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.700
you started to see some
of the consequences,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.780
the more immediate consequences,
of some of the properties

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.340
we've been discussing
over the last few lectures

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.760
of binary liquid mixtures.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.172
And in particular he
started showing you

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:41.130
some of the colligative
properties by which you

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.250
see changes in the vapor
pressure and the boiling point

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.870
and so forth, that arise because
you've got liquids in mixtures

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.140
and this affects their
chemical potentials.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.230
And today I want
to start by going

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.460
through the fourth colligative
property that's commonly seen,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.694
what called osmotic pressure.

00:00:57.694 --> 00:00:58.860
And I mentioned this before.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.210
Today we'll go through a
quantitative calculation

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.350
of its effects.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.090
And then we'll start in on a
different unit of the course.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.930
We'll start in on
statistical mechanics.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:28.370
So let's continue with the
colligative properties.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.400
And osmotic pressure plays a
super-important role, certainly

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.100
in all of biology, because of
course inside biological cells

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.419
you have solutions.

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:38.210
Water is in there,
along with a whole bunch

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.830
of other components.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.890
And so the chemical
potential of the water

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.240
is strongly affected by
all the other constituents.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.660
And this has profound
effects on what's

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.620
involved in maintaining an
equilibrium between what

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.040
goes on inside and
outside of the cell.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.850
And this is the case
in all organisms.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.410
And it's also
exploited of course

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.350
in all sorts of other contexts.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.280
So what's happening with
osmotic pressure is,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.280
you've got some
situation where there's

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.880
a semi-permeable membrane.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.690
It allows one of
the constituents

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.460
but not others to pass through.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.590
And typically that's water.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.550
Although, of course,
it could be anything.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.090
So, in the lab the way
this typically looks

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.370
is something like this.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:42.080
Here's your
semi-permeable membrane.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.940
Outside, we can
imagine that there's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.580
pure liquid A. Could be water,
could be something else.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.430
Inside, you've got
A mixed with B,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.180
one or more other constituents.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.000
And then there's some
level of the liquid

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.480
outside the container.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.350
Of course, A can pass between,
pass through, the membrane.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.340
And so what ends up
happening is, if you just

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.470
look at the situation,
what you immediately

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.580
notice is that
the liquid in here

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.852
goes up higher than
the liquid around it.

00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:28.810
It's at a higher level.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.270
It seems counterintuitive
at first.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.880
And in fact it can
be enormously higher.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.030
But that's what happens.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:47.690
So there's extra height, h,
of liquid inside the container

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.910
relative to what's outside it.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.970
And what that means is
the pressure inside here

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.100
must be higher, right?

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.160
Of course, the
weight of this liquid

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.730
is pushing down on
what's down here.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.210
So the pressure
inside here is higher

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.820
than the pressure outside.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.910
But of course, from
what you know already

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.280
about liquid mixtures, this
should in fact make sense.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.690
Because what's happening
is that if these things are

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.670
at the same pressure, you know
that the chemical potential

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.250
of A is going to be
lower in the mixture.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.050
It's always lower in the
mixture than it is in pure A.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.620
So there's nothing to
stop A from rushing in.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.170
So A does rush in.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.830
If the liquid level goes up, it
raises the pressure down here.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.470
But as the pressure rises,
now the chemical potential

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.520
changes and goes up.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.290
So eventually, equilibrium
is reestablished.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.040
Because these aren't
at the same pressure.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.890
The additional pressure means
the chemical potential of A

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:46.680
goes up.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.570
Of course, it goes down by
virtue of being in the mixture.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.426
And those two things will
eventually reach an equilibrium

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:53.800
where the chemical
potential of A

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.550
is the same everywhere,
as it has to be.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.930
So what we'll
calculate now is, OK,

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.210
how much does the
pressure go up.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.140
When that happens.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.467
So let's take a look.

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:07.550
And so of course, there
are all kinds of examples.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.340
In a typical one,
A would be water.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.310
And B would be one
or more sugars.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.790
All sorts of other
potential constituents also.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.820
OK, so let's just
consider the pressure

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.090
at two places that
are the same level.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.500
The same height.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.640
We'll label this
one point alpha.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:41.710
Let's put some color in here.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.690
We'll have points
alpha and beta.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:54.450
And we'll make this distance l.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.970
So now let's just
first calculate

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.764
what the pressure
is at both points.

00:05:57.764 --> 00:05:59.430
It's going to be
higher here, because of

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.340
this additional liquid on top.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:11.130
So, if we look at
point alpha, well,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.630
let's start at point
beta, actually.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.254
That's the simpler
one since it doesn't

00:06:14.254 --> 00:06:17.800
have the additional liquid.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.470
And first of all, there's
just atmospheric pressure.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.140
So there's an external pressure.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.960
Certainly, typically, it would
just be atmosphere pressure.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.880
It's pushing down here.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.560
It's also there.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.090
So that has to factor in.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.060
So there's our
external pressure.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.410
And then there is the
product of this height

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.370
times the density
of the solution.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.740
Times the gravitational
force constant.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.070
And I'll work through
that momentarily

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.690
so you see that that
indeed is the pressure.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.770
That's exerted by
the amount of liquid

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.360
that's up above this level.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:22.040
But before I do that, let's put
the pressure at point alpha.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.690
So p alpha.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:29.840
And that's p external
plus l rho g.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.910
But now, there's this additional
height on top of that.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.960
So there's also h rho g.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.730
There's an extra pressure.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:55.510
We'll label this pi.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:05.080
So we can write p alpha is
equals to p beta plus h rho g.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:15.280
Which we'll say is
equal to p beta plus pi.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.290
Now, just to make sure
we're all on the same page

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.310
about these quantities
being the pressure that's

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.690
exerted by the liquid,
let's just look at that.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:38.800
So l times rho times g.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:45.280
It should be a pressure which
is a force per unit area.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:56.200
And in particular, this is going
to be a weight per unit area.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.100
Remember the weight is the
force that a mass exerts.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.820
And it exerts it because of
the gravitational constant.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.600
So what happens?

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:17.490
Well, this is just a length.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:22.600
Rho is a density, right?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:36.630
So it's mass per unit volume.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:47.690
And of course, g is just our
gravitational force constant.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:53.110
So it'll be in units of
meters per second squared.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.100
So what's going to happen?

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.710
If we multiply l
times rho together,

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.210
this is units of length.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.890
This is units of volume.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.005
What we're going to get
then is mass per unit area.

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.380
And that's what
it is, of course.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.160
It's distributing across
the area of that surface

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.310
where point alpha is.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:20.350
So these two
together, l times rho,

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:29.270
give us mass per unit area.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:34.970
So it could be in
units of kilograms.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.370
Per unit area, per
meters squared.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.550
And now we're going to multiply
that by the gravitational force

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.460
constant.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.790
So now we're going
to have all together

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:55.240
kilograms per meter
second squared.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:11.370
In other words, it's
force per unit area.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.090
And so that's what we have.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.430
And now, of course, we have
the additional component.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:22.020
Due to the height here.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.740
Now, what do we know about
the chemical potential

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.770
in both parts?

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.430
The chemical potential
has to be equal

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.590
outside and inside
the container.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:45.880
So mu A at point
alpha is just mu A

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:54.070
of the liquid at pressure p
plus pi and temperature T.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:12:00.170
And that has to be equal
to mu A at point beta.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.400
But point beta is just
in the pure liquid.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.155
So that's just mu A
star of the liquid

00:12:08.155 --> 00:12:15.350
at pressure p and
temperature T. So here's

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:22.960
the chemical potential
at point beta.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.470
Here it is at point alpha.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.570
Those two have to be
equal to each other.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:32.310
And now we're just going
to use Raoult's law.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.820
And what does that tell us?

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:44.280
We have RT log of xA plus mu A
star of the liquid at pressure

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.460
p plus pi and T So there
is our chemical potential

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.780
inside the container.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:13:01.110
And that's equal to mu A star of
the pure liquid at point beta.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:09.150
And so we can just
rewrite this as RT log xA.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:16.080
Plus mu A star liquid
at pressure p plus pi

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:25.640
of T minus mu A star at
pressure p is equal to zero.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.510
OK., now we need the
pressure dependence

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.610
of the chemical potential.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:37.320
But we certainly have
an expression for that.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:47.440
So we know that dG
is S dT plus V dp.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.450
The temperature is the
same on both sides.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.880
But we need to worry about what
happens at different pressures.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:14:04.930
So at constant T, dG is V dp.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.390
So now if we look at the
chemical potential, which

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:12.980
is just the Gibbs
free energy per mole,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:28.050
then d mu A star is
VA star molar dp.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.620
In other words, the difference
in the chemical potential

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.190
is, this changes as a
function of pressure.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.900
Is going to be given by
the molar volume of a

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.630
under these conditions
in the pure liquid dp.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.810
It's just the potential,
the pressure dependence

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:52.510
of G. It's not the kind of
topic I would have thought

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.110
would drive away
a lot of people.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.560
But, you never know.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.264
OK.

00:14:59.264 --> 00:15:01.430
For the rest of you who are
willing to bear with me,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.600
let's continue.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.620
So now let's just integrate.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:14.200
We need to know the change in mu
A at a finite jump in pressure

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.060
from inside to
outside the container.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.540
So we're just
going to integrate.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:30.380
So if I want mu A
star at pressure p

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:39.180
plus pi minus mu A
star at pressure p,

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:49.130
then I just have to integrate
from p to p plus pi VA bar star

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.207
dp.

00:15:50.207 --> 00:15:52.290
And now I'm going to assume,
and this is certainly

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.460
a safe assumption, that this
quantity this, molar volume,

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.690
isn't going to change.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.250
In other words, the
molar volume of liquid A

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.340
isn't going to
change significantly,

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.360
going from the pressure out
here to the pressure in here.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.220
On the grand scale of things
it's a small pressure change.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.930
We can assume that the
liquid is incompressible

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.877
over that small pressure change.

00:16:13.877 --> 00:16:15.710
Which means that this
is constant, since all

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:27.330
we have then is simply
VA bar star times pi.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.930
So then, substituting
back here, so now

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.890
we've calculated
this difference,

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.340
it's a simple result.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:42.980
So then we simply have
that RT log xA plus VA bar

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:50.810
star pi is equal to zero.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.020
Now, you saw last time,
and I'll work through this

00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:01.950
quickly again,
that the log of xA

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:08.660
can be written approximately
as minus nB over nA

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.530
if you remember, this
came from writing

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:17.460
that this is equal to
the log of one minus xB.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:21.650
But we're assuming that B is
the minor constituent here.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.070
So xB is a small number.

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:30.840
So that this is roughly
equal to minus xB.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:38.430
And that's just minus
nB over nA plus nB.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.760
And since nB is much
smaller than nA,

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:48.400
this is approximately
equal to minus nB over nA.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.540
So we're going to make
this substitution.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.300
Also, this quantity,
this molar volume

00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:04.200
of A over the pure liquid, since
the concentration of B is low,

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.180
we can assume that
this is just the molar

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.610
volume of A in general.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:16.410
So, in other words, we
can write VA bar star.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:21.600
We can just write it as VA bar.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.550
That is, we're
not going to worry

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.340
about changes in
the molar volume,

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:29.190
either as a function of pressure
or a function of concentration

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.350
at the low concentrations
that we're working.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:39.730
And then, note that
nA times VA per mole

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.710
is just the total volume.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.450
Oops, not bar.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:44.550
Not the molar quantity.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.260
This is the molar
quantity multiplied

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.120
by the number of moles.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.360
So it just gives us VA, the
total volume, occupied by A.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:19:05.040
And using these two results,
then we have that RT times

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:11.160
negative nB over nA,
that's this result.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:21.970
Plus VA over nA times pi is
equal to zero. nA will cancel.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:27.420
And finally, since almost
all the volume is due to A,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.220
again because B is
the minor constituent,

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:39.060
we can approximate further that
VA is approximately equal to V.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.900
So finally getting rid of
the nA on the denominators,

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.650
we're left with a
simple expression.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:58.500
pi times V is RT nB.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.670
So we have a very
simple expression

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.190
which is called the
van't Hoff expression,

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.690
and look at how it
resembles the ideal gas law.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.170
This is the pressure
times the volume equals

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.460
the number of moles times RT.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:17.090
Of course, really it's
a change in pressure.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.950
And this number of
moles is the number

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:24.620
of moles of a guest
constituent in a solution.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:29.860
But it has the same form
that you're familiar with.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.840
We also, sometimes it's
convenient to substitute,

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:40.200
since nB over V, that's
just the concentration.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:50.190
That's the number of
moles over the volume.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.110
And in that case,
the expression is

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:58.100
rewritten as pi is RT times c,
where it's understood that this

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:06.510
is the concentration
of the solute.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:14.320
OK, any questions?

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.400
Let's work through
a numerical problem.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.650
These things can seem a little
bit, they can seem simple,

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.650
but sometimes when
confronted with a problem,

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.580
sometimes it may seem less
than obvious what to do.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.200
And also the results can
seem a little bit surprising.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.190
So I just want to work through
a simple numerical example

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.850
to see how these play out.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:51.670
So let's try, let's imagine we
have 10 grams of unknown solid.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:22:09.780
Dissolved in 1000
grams of water.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:22.550
The vapor pressure is
25.195 torr at 27 degrees C.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:35.190
And the pure water vapor
pressure is 25.000.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:43.580
No, .200 torr at the
same temperature.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:53.790
So first, let's just
calculate the molecular weight

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.770
of the solid.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.346
Now, this you I think,
saw from last time.

00:22:58.346 --> 00:22:59.470
So this is straightforward.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.220
It's going to come from
the vapor pressure lowering

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.870
not from the osmotic
pressure, which we'll do next.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:19.210
So the delta p of H2O is
minus xB times p star of H2O.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.490
Alright, this is from last time.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.600
The expression for the
vapor pressure reduction.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:31.420
Due to the concentration
of the mole fraction of B.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:42.590
And then xB is 0.005
torr over 25.2 torr.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.410
Right?

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:49.470
And that's 1.98 times
10 to the minus 4.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:57.860
So that's our mole
fraction of B.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:06.750
And then xB is nB
over nA plus nB.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:12.330
So, now we have
this, it's 10 grams

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:18.210
divided by the molecular weight,
which is in grams per mole,

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:23.480
over 1000 grams of water.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:34.560
Divided by 18 grams
per mole plus 10 grams

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:40.900
divided by the molecular
weight in grams per mole.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.080
But since the solution
is overwhelmingly water,

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.712
we can get rid of this term
and make the math simple.

00:24:47.712 --> 00:24:48.420
Can you see that?

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.510
I guess barely.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:25:00.220
So this turns out to be about
1.98 time 10 to the minus 4.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.770
And if we solve for
molecular weight,

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:13.030
then we wind up with
907 grams per mole.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.520
So that's using one of
the colligative properties

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.960
that you saw last time.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:27.030
Now let's, though,
finish up by calculating

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.250
the additional pressure
that we'll find.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:42.730
So what's the osmotic
pressure of the solution.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.840
So now we're going to assume
that we have that solution

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.370
inside, in a situation
like this where there's

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.650
pure water outside
that can go in.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.050
And there's going to be
excess pressure because

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.600
of the water rushing
into the solution.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:01.940
So what happens?

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.570
And let's use a
value of the density.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:15.600
0.995 grams per
centimeters cubed.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:24.000
So, pi is RT times c.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:35.270
That's 0.08314 bar
per Kelvin mole.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:48.400
Times 300 K times
c. c is nB over V.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:57.500
So it's 10 grams divided
by 907 grams per mole,

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:08.100
over 1010 grams over 0.995
grams per milliliter,

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.080
I'm equating with
centimeter cubed.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:17.160
And that turns out
to be 1.09 times 10

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:22.890
to the minus 5th
mole per millileter.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.330
Let's get that into liters.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:31.340
So we'll multiply by 1000
milliliters per liter.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:39.280
So it's 1.09 times 10 to
the 5th moles per liter.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.230
OK, yeah.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:44.780
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:49.870
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.890
Oh, don't forget that, right.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.160
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.750
PROFESSOR: Ah, yes, yes, yes.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:05.830
And I think that's the
case in the notes also.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:06.840
Yep.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.450
Thank you.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:13.925
OK, so the concentration,
just to calibrate us here,

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:15.550
it's a pretty low
concentration, right?

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:20.770
It's about 10 to the
minus 5 moles per liter.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:27.169
The excess pressure is 0.27 bar.

00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:29.210
In other words, about a
quarter of an atmosphere.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.210
Uh-oh, what's happening?

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:34.240
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.240
PROFESSOR: Where are we?

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.110
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.010
PROFESSOR: Sorry, where exactly?

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:48.490
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.230
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.720
Yes, sorry.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.890
Yeah.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.650
10 to the minus 2
moles per liter.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:58.490
All right.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.650
And so the pressure that results
is a modest pressure, right?

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.800
It's about a quarter of an
atmosphere of excess pressure.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:13.340
2.7 time 10 to the 4 pascals.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.900
So let's just calculate, given
this small additional pressure,

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.860
how high is the
liquid going to go,

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:26.380
above the level of the solution.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.080
Anybody want to guess?

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.460
You know, a centimeter.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.430
10 centimeters.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.040
100 centimeters?

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.520
Give me an order of magnitude.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.700
Who guesses one centimeter?

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.690
You got three choices.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.040
One, 10 and 100, and
you have to make one.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.250
Who guesses one centimeter?

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.040
Who guesses 10 centimeters?

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.020
Who guesses 100 centimeters?

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.260
OK.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.520
Now, fortunately we
don't do problem sets.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:58.320
Or other scientific
problems by popular vote.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.830
Rather, we just solve them.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.500
Whenever possible.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:15.030
So, what's the height
of a column of solution?

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:22.050
Well, that pi, remember, that's
equal to rho times g times h,

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:22.830
right?

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.520
And we know pi now.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:30.240
So h is pi over rho times g.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:36.410
So it's 2.7 times
10 to the 4 pascal

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:43.870
over rho, that's 0.995
grams per centimeters cubed.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:56.010
Times 1 kilogram over 1000 grams
times 100 centimeters per meter

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:56.510
cubed.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.670
I'm just getting
this into units that

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.350
will give me, that
will be in meters,

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:06.280
times 9.8 meter per
a second squared.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:13.230
And when I multiply all
that out, it's 2.8 meters.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:18.360
So that puny little pressure
ends up being meters high.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.550
Taller than any of us, by far.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.270
Sorry, it's up to there.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.730
And that's actually
pretty typical.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:31.450
And what that means is, it
actually makes osmotic pressure

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:35.240
a very, very sensitive
measurement method.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.430
If you want to determine a
molecular weight, for example.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.220
Because it's so
high, that means,

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.720
and of course you can measure
that height pretty accurately.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.420
Certainly within
about a millimeter.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.106
And so even relatively
modest concentrations,

00:31:50.106 --> 00:31:52.480
it's still easy to see the
effect and measure the impact.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:58.860
And use that to calculate
the properties of the solute.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.990
OK, any questions?

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:07.840
Alright.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.770
Now we're going to
start something new.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:17.550
So, so far what you've seen,
and I hope come to appreciate,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.370
is the whole structure
of thermodynamics

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:25.560
is built on empirical
macroscopic observation

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.750
and deduction.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.030
We observe things.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:33.380
We formulate these broad
thermodynamic laws.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.370
All macroscopic.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.790
It doesn't depend on any
microscopic model at all.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.600
And in fact much of
it was formulated

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.930
before there was a good
microscopic model of matter.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.610
Before the atomic theory
of matter, and molecules,

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:50.230
and so forth was
well worked out.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:56.570
And it's incredible how powerful
that whole formalism is, right?

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.830
In some sense,
although it may seem

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:03.460
like neglecting what
we now know to be

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.190
an important part of nature,
actually part of its power

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.090
is its empiricism.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:09.680
Right?

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.010
There are these
very small number

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:16.579
of fundamental laws from
which everything else follows.

00:33:16.579 --> 00:33:18.120
And at this point,
of course, there's

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.240
just enormous confidence in
that small number of laws.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.690
Because of their being
verified in so many context.

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:29.180
But, at the same
time, we do know

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.340
about the atomic
theory of matter.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.920
We know there are
atoms and molecules.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.650
So it ought to be possible,
at least in principle,

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:42.350
to start from a purely
microscopic approach to nature.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:48.650
And just based on figuring out
the microscopic properties.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.970
And then saying, well,
OK, my macroscopic stuff

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:55.240
is just a collection of
those microscopic entities.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.240
I should also be able to figure
out macroscopic thermodynamics.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.380
I should be able to start
from my microscopic picture

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.890
and get to macroscopic
thermodynamic results.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.760
And in fact, that is possible.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.210
And the theoretical
formulation for it

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:13.180
is what's called
statistical mechanics.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.710
Called that because,
of course, you

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.650
won't be surprised
to learn that it's

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.090
going to require a
statistical treatment.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.660
We're going to be dealing
with moles of material.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.030
But now we're going
to be trying to think

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.920
about their
microscopic properties.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.500
And so we'll be dealing not with
n number of moles, but with 10

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.650
to the 24th number of
molecules or atoms.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:40.180
And you know we won't
be able to keep track

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:44.890
of every one of their
individual states, all the time.

00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:48.330
We may be able to do a terrific
calculation of the quantum

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.660
mechanics or the
classical mechanics that

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:54.070
describe the states
that they could be in.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.070
But there's no way in
practice that we're either

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:59.070
going to experimentally
or theoretically keep

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.580
track of all of that.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.280
So we're going
to, at some point,

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.700
have to introduce statistics.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.750
To take what we know about
the microscopic properties

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.920
and try to go from there
to the macroscopic results.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.100
The thermodynamics
that we've seen so far.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:34.050
And that's what statistical
mechanics is all about.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:42.560
So let's try to
introduce a little bit

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.070
of statistical mechanics.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.400
Where we're going
to go from what

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.010
we know about
microscopic properties

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.870
all the way to macroscopic
thermodynamics.

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:58.510
That's our objective.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:04.100
So let's start by just
trying to calculate

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.080
energies of
individual molecules,

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.500
or individual particles.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:13.790
And what's the probability
that some molecule, one

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.870
of the oxygen molecules
somewhere in this room,

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.870
is in a certain energy state.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.380
Right?

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.280
And what our strategy
is going to be,

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.420
is to determine what are the
probabilities that molecules

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.880
are in certain states
with certain energies.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.820
And if we can determine that
for all the possible states,

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.250
then we can average over those.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:40.450
So without keeping track of
every individual molecule,

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.879
we could then calculate,
an average energy,

00:36:42.879 --> 00:36:44.920
which is what you would
measure thermodynamically

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.169
when you look at the whole
collection and measure what

00:36:47.169 --> 00:36:48.790
we call u, right?

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:50.190
Of course, we're
really averaging

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.750
over disparate energies
of lots of different atoms

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:54.820
or molecules.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.210
They don't all have the
same molecular energy.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.930
And we don't try to measure
their individual energies.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.690
So that's what we'd
like to calculate.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.620
And so we'd like
to be able to know

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.790
what are all these probabilities
of different energy states.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.440
And then from
that, statistically

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.210
averaging, what are the
macroscopic average energies.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.710
And other macroscopic
quantities.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:22.550
So, let's start there.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:40.030
Probability that a
molecule, must be specific

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:50.910
as possible is in
state i with energy Ei.

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:52.825
And right now we're
not even going

00:37:52.825 --> 00:37:55.580
to specify the
nature of the state.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:59.190
We could be worrying about
translational energy.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.800
What state it is, how fast
it's whizzing around the room.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.680
We could worry about its
vibrational or rotational

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.500
energy, or electronic state.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.870
For now, let's not
even specify it.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.830
Let's just say the
only thing we're really

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:14.360
specifying about
the state is it has

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:19.200
some energy that
we presumably know.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:27.460
Now, what we'd like is
to know a functional

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.930
form for the probability.

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:32.530
And we don't know one a priori.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:38.570
But let's just think
about two molecules.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.990
And the probability
that one of them

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:45.450
has energy i, and another
one has energy Ej.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.370
It also, let me say, would be
sufficient to think about even

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.040
one molecule and
say, we'll let's

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.417
think about independent
parts of its energy.

00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:54.500
Let's say, translational
energy in this direction.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.680
And in an orthogonal direction.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:02.190
What matters is, we're thinking
about two independent energies.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.160
Could be separate molecules
that aren't interacting.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.930
Or independent degrees of
freedom on the same molecule.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.500
But let's just consider it.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:25.360
So a molecule is in state
i, and that another molecule

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:35.870
is in state j, with energy Ej.

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:39.110
So what we're going to calculate
is the joint probability

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:42.830
that the two molecules
are in those states.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:46.040
So we want a probability.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:52.090
This one, we'll call Pi(Ei).

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:58.100
This would be Pj of Ej.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.370
And this probability together
will be Pij(Ei + Ej).

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.400
I could just write Ei comma
Ej, but the energy's add.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.120
And that's crucial.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.600
Now, since the molecules
are completely independent,

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:29.850
this should just be the product
of the separate probabilities.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.420
Two completely
independent events,

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:37.210
or things whose probability
we want to determine together.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:41.320
So, that suggests a really
simple functional form.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:48.070
Because what we're saying here
is we want a function of a plus

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:54.000
b, which is equal to the same
sort of function of a times

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.910
the same sort of function of b.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:59.100
In other words, when we
multiply these functions,

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:05.460
we get a function of the
sum of those arguments.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:11.800
What functional form does that?

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.770
Exponential.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:17.150
Sure.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:21.000
So in other words,
e to the a plus

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.240
b power equals e to
the a times e to the b.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:35.000
So it suggests that there's
an exponential probability.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.740
Suggests it.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:49.160
Now, there's also
some physical insight

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.940
that we can apply
to the problem.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:56.040
First of all, we
expect that states

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.550
with higher energy
in general are

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:02.700
going to be less probable
than states with lower energy.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.205
If it's cold, not much
thermal energy around,

00:42:06.205 --> 00:42:07.580
and you say, how
much energy does

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.570
a particle in an equilibrium
collection of particles have,

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.370
at thermal equilibrium, if
there's not much thermal energy

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.830
around, you don't expect
it to be very likely

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:19.760
that a particle has a
huge amount of energy.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.390
That one individual
particle has it.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:22.970
Could happen, right?

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.660
From some random
collisions that just

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.780
happened to bulk up the
energy of that one particle.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.330
But on a balance it's not
going to be very probable.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:34.200
Lower energies will
be more probable.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.030
And the other thing is, even
in thinking about something

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.880
like that, temperature comes in.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.950
Immediately.

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:42.262
Right?

00:42:42.262 --> 00:42:43.720
If you raise the
temperature a lot,

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.800
surely we have to expect
many more molecules will

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.410
start to become energized.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.890
Will have more energy.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:55.230
So, lower probability
for higher energy.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.730
But the probability
of higher energy

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:59.780
should go up if the
temperature goes up.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.930
In other words, the ratio
of energy to temperature

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.330
should be involved here.

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:20.910
So, P of Ei should go
down as Ei goes up.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:30.930
And should depend
on Ei over T. Right?

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:35.800
So, we can start with
this functional form.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:40.070
And by the way, there's
no reason we can't have,

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.740
in general we would have
some constants here, right?

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.870
We haven't changed
anything to do that.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.900
And now let's just
use the little bit

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.220
of physical intuition that
we're thinking about here,

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.640
to refine this
just a little bit.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:00.570
Let's write, we
expect that Pi of Ei

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:10.210
is some exponential to
the minus C Ei over T,

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:13.130
where C is some constant
greater than zero.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:17.620
So this will have the property,
then, that as energy goes up,

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:18.940
the probability goes down.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.560
But it's scaled by temperature.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.570
If I raise the temperature, that
makes the higher energy states

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:30.500
get more and more likely.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:39.270
Well, this is our
functional form

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:43.320
for probability of a
molecule being in a state

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.980
with energy Ei.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.170
And the only difference
between this and what's

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:51.930
written conventionally is the
way the constant is labeled.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:58.070
So really what we
have is Pi of Ei

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:06.640
is proportional to e to the
minus Ei over kB T, or just k

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:17.050
T, where kB is called
the Boltzmann constant.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:21.680
And it's just equal to R
over Avogadro's number.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:30.700
It's the gas constant per
molecule, rather than per mole.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:37.080
One way to try to rationalize
this is, you've probably seen,

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.580
you've all seen Arrhenius
kinetics, right?

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:44.540
Arrhenius rate laws?

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:53.140
If you remember what
that looks like,

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.090
you get this rate constant.

00:45:56.090 --> 00:46:00.663
Arrhenius rate constant
is some constant A times e

00:46:00.663 --> 00:46:05.460
to the minus Ea over RT.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.510
Remember that?

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:10.720
You've all seen that before?

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.720
And so what's
happening here, Ea is

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.300
what is an activation energy.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.390
Remember, the idea
is that you've

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.180
got reactants and
products, and there's

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.140
some barrier you've
got to get over.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:29.480
The activation energy,
before you can have reaction.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.640
So the rate depends on
surmounting that activation

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.390
barrier.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.960
This is really coming
from the same idea

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:44.340
as this, which is the
probability of one

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.920
of the molecules having
this much energy.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.230
Depends on e to the
minus energy over RT.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.320
This is per mole,
so this is per mole.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.980
The exact same relation.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.100
So the idea in the
context of kinetics

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:04.540
is that the rate depends on how
many molecules can get up here.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.690
And what the probability is
of their getting enough energy

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:10.040
to go over the barrier.

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:11.700
And that energy,
that probability,

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.520
is given by this expression.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.320
So in this form you've seen
this kind of dependence

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:29.080
before in a very explicit way.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:36.740
Let me just take it one small
but important step farther.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:42.790
Which is that
proportionality constant.

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:45.450
Couldn't we do better?

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:49.560
Couldn't we say, couldn't we
figure out what exactly it is,

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.520
not just what it's
proportional to?

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.260
Well, let's try.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:58.850
So as we've written
it, we've got Pi of Ei

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:03.660
is proportional to e to
the minus Ei over kT.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:08.150
We could write that as equals
A e to the minus Ei over kT.

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:12.050
This is just some
proportionality constant.

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:14.710
But we can determine
what that constant is,

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:22.480
because we know that if we sum
over all the possible states,

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.550
the molecule has to be
in some state, right?

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:30.930
So that sum of all those
probabilities has to equal one.

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:37.560
So sum over i of Pi of
Ei, is equal to one.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:44.270
Because the molecule must
be in one of the states.

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:49.030
OK, now this is our expression
for all those p i's.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.790
So let's just write that way.
a is just a constant times

00:48:52.790 --> 00:49:03.130
the sum over all the i's of
e to the minus Ei over kT.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:09.480
And so there it is. a is equal
to one over the sum over i, e

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:17.070
to the minus Ei over kT.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:25.160
So now we can
rewrite Pi of Ei is

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:32.780
equal to e to the minus Ei
over kT over, the sum over i, e

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:41.600
to the minus Ei over kT.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:47.190
Now, just so you're not
confused, this i matters.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:48.772
That's the i we're
talking about.

00:49:48.772 --> 00:49:51.230
What's the probability of it
being in some particular state

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.540
i with energy e i.

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.390
This i is just a dummy variable.

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:57.480
So just to be explicit,
we could write this just

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.220
as well as e to the
minus Ei over kT

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:09.760
times the sum over j, e
to the minus Ej over kT.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.890
It could be confusing, but
this is usually the way

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:13.330
that it's written.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.760
Even though this
dummy variable here

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.710
has nothing to do with
the particular choice

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:23.550
that's made here.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.780
So now we know.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:29.370
And we can calculate what the
probability is for a molecule

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:31.030
to be in any
particular state if we

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:32.765
know the energy of that state.

00:50:32.765 --> 00:50:34.890
Now, notice we need to know
all the energies of all

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:36.160
the other states, too.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:40.590
Because this thing,
in other words,

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:45.440
this a, right, depends on
summing over all of those.

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.020
But if we know those,
then we can do it.

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.390
We can do the whole calculation.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:52.610
And for a good number of
cases, we realistically

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:55.600
do know it all.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:00.120
So from the proportionality
relationship alone,

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.610
of course, we can tell
the ratio of chances

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:06.760
that you're in one
state or another.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:10.430
Even without this a
constant, we already

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.640
could've said well, if
what's the ratio of,

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.890
the probability of being in
state i with energy Ei to state

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:21.460
j with energy Ej.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.180
Well, it's just e to the
minus Ei over kT over e

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.730
to the minus Ej over kT.

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:37.110
It's e to the minus
Ei minus Ej over kT.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:39.440
But apart from just being
able to get the ratio,

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.020
we can get the absolute number.

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.225
What's the absolute
probability that a molecule

00:51:44.225 --> 00:51:50.260
is in any particular
state of a given energy.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.290
Next time what
you'll see is what

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:56.390
can be calculated based on
the results that you've seen,

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:00.570
just the results
you've seen so far.

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:04.630
From these quantities
alone, it turns out

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:07.930
you'll be able to calculate
every single macroscopic

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:12.560
thermodynamic quantity.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.569
So you'll see some
of that next time.
