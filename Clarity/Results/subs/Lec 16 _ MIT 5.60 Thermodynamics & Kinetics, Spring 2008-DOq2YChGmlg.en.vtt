00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:27.250
PROFESSOR: I want to remind
and clarify as needed the

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:36.420
equilibrium constant Kp for
gas phase reaction was the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.060
ratios of the partial pressures
referenced to some

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.110
reference pressure, which we
usually take as one, one bar.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.952
To the stoichiometry , pD
divided by p naught, to the mu

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:57.910
D where species C and
D are products.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:11.540
And the reactants are
on the bottom.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.350
And usually we don't write p
naught, but it's important to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.380
remember that it's there.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.360
And then we can also write this
in terms of the Gibbs

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.170
free energy for the reaction.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.920
The standard Gibbs free energy,
minus delta G naught

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.570
of the reaction,
divided by RT.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.860
And what this tells us is
that this is a number.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.930
This is a number, there's
no pre-factor

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.240
here that has units.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.640
That's a unitless number.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:04.410
And it doesn't depend on
the total pressure.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.905
And the other thing to remember
is that delta G

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:10.080
naught for the reaction is
the process of taking the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.760
reactants separated in separate
boxes, separate

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.090
containers, and the final
product, the final step, is

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.350
the products separated in
individual containers.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.435
That's what we write when
we write delta G

00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:30.190
naught for the reaction.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.340
We also looked at K in terms
of mole fractions.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.020
So if you replace all the
partial pressures with the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.360
mole fraction times the total
pressure, you get an

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.560
expression for K sub x, which we
define as the mole fraction

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:59.140
of the products to the
stoichiometric powers.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.420
Which is also unitless.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.880
This is true, it's unitless.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.940
But, if you write it in terms of
K sub p, the total pressure

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.880
comes in here. p total, divided
by the reference

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.770
pressure to the minus delta nu,
where this is the change

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.010
in the number of moles,
in going from

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.330
reactants to products.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.810
And there's K sub
p sitting here.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.620
So unlike K sub p, which doesn't
depend on the total

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.040
pressure, K sub x does depend on
the total pressure through

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:47.340
this term right here.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.970
So when we look at problems
where we change the pressure,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.300
the total pressure of
the system, this is

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.400
going to stay the same.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.130
Because it only cares
about delta G

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.880
naught for the reaction.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.586
But this K sub x will depend
on the total pressure.

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:10.330
And that's often a source of
confusion in doing problems.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.700
OK, any questions?

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.060
We're going to do an example
where we change

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.600
the pressure first.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.340
So there are examples in the
notes, and I'm going to skip

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.470
the first one.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.930
I'm going to go to the second
one, which is the effect of

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.840
the total pressure
on the reaction.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.840
And Le Chatelier's principle,
for pressure.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.720
And the example we're going to
take is a fairly standard

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.040
example, also.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:46.450
Which is the reaction of N2O4,
which is a gas, to 2 NO2,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.670
which is a gas, the kind of
reaction that happens when you

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:59.080
have smog and, fairly common
in big cities.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.130
The question we're going to ask
is, what happens when we

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.690
change the total pressure
in this reaction here.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.600
Which way does the
equilibrium go?

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.700
Does it go to the right,
does it go to the left?

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.650
Does it go to the products
or the reactants.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.270
And so, in order to answer that
question, we're going to

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.970
ask a slightly different
question.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.280
We're going to ask what is the
molar ratio, what is the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.270
fraction, what is fraction
of the reactant,

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:39.920
the N2O4 that's reacted.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.120
That has reacted.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.800
And we're going to
call that alpha.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:56.470
It's the number of moles that
have reacted divided by number

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:03.350
of moles initially.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.110
So we're going to need to find
at equilibrium what is the

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.950
number of moles of N2O4
that has reacted.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.640
So we have to set
up the problem.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.180
And so the way that, the
standard way of setting up the

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:30.300
problem is to write the
equilibrium, 2 NO2 gas.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.650
And then on this line here, we
write the initial conditions

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.490
before we set up the
equilibrium.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.960
And let's say that we
have n moles of N2O4

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.880
initially in the box.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.550
And zero moles of the NO2.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.970
So we have n moles here.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.320
And zero moles here.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.170
At equilibrium, let's write
the number of moles.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.640
A certain number of moles of
N2O4 will have reacted, let's

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.880
call that x.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.940
So n minus x moles left.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.970
For every x moles of N2O4 that's
reacted, we create two

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.820
moles of NO2.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.270
So we have 2x here.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.060
And then we're going to need
the total number of moles,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.060
because we're going
to be doing mole

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.460
ratios, mole fractions.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:15.020
So the total number of moles
at any time is the sum of

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.130
these two, n minus x plus 2x.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.900
It's n plus x.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.020
So if we're going to be writing
our equilibrium

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.780
constant in terms of mole
fractions, we're going to need

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.180
mole fractions.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.010
So the mole fraction at any time
is n minus x divided by

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.290
the total number of moles,
which we just

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.110
calculated as n plus x.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.210
And this is 2x divided by
the total number of

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.610
moles, n plus x.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:49.640
And what we want is
this ratio here.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:55.070
We want the ratio of the number
of moles reacted, which

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:01.010
is x, that's the number
of moles that's gone.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.560
That have reacted.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.130
Divided by the number of moles
initially, which is n.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.120
That's what we want.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.740
We want to see how that is going
to change with pressure.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.160
So we're going to deal first
with Kp, because Kp doesn't

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.990
depend on total pressure.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.870
We're going to write
that down.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.850
Then we're going to
go to Kx, somehow.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.040
And that's going to depend
on pressure.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:37.160
So let's see what Kp is here.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.020
So K sub p, you've got
the products on top.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.490
So it's the partial pressure
of NO2 to the second power,

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.900
divided by the partial
pressure of

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.130
N2O4 to the one power.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.600
And everything is referenced
to one bar,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.180
everything's in bar.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.060
And in terms of the molar
fractions, it's the total

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:04.380
pressure squared, times the mole
fraction of NO2 squared,

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.290
divided by the total pressure
to the first power.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.680
So the square root on
top gets divided by

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.350
one factor of pressure.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.830
So we have total pressure
in front.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:25.340
Divided by x to the N2O4,
and that's p times Kx.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.950
So let's plug in what these mole
fractions are from our

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.950
table here.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:35.930
The mole fraction of NO2 is
2x divided by n plus x.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.040
2x divided by n plus x
to the square power.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.650
Mole fraction of N2O4, n minus
x over n plus x. n minus x

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.560
over n plus x.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.270
Multiply, square the
top, 4x squared.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.220
Divided by n plus x squared.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.900
Things sort of cancel out here.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.770
Rearrange.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:05.830
4x squared divided by n squared
minus x squared.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.220
What we're really interested
in is, we're not

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.550
interested in x.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.690
We're interested in
x divided by n.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.610
So let's divide both the top and
the bottom by n squared.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.120
And we're going to get
alpha come up.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:28.200
So this is then p times 4 alpha
squared divided by one

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.350
minus alpha squared.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.390
This is not, there's no
total pressure here.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.310
The only way, the only place,
where the total pressure comes

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.500
in, is right here.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.655
This is just a number that
doesn't care what the total

00:10:44.655 --> 00:10:45.250
pressure is.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.260
Which is why we're using it.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.810
And not K sub x, which cares
what the total pressure is.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.590
So now we can solve for alpha.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:11:03.870
We can solve for alpha by
rearranging this equation.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.140
This is just a number.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.290
And this is where the total
pressure comes in.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.020
So you rearrange that, and you
get alpha is equal to 1 plus

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:22.050
4p divided by Kp, to the
minus 1/2 power.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.080
And if I rewrite that slightly
to make it a little bit easier

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.880
to see what's going to happen,
when I change the pressure, 1

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:37.120
plus 4p divided by Kp,
to the 1/2 power.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.530
And that's what I'm after.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:48.910
This tells me what happens at
equilibrium to the amount of

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:53.250
NO2 as I change the
total pressure.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.780
This is the only place
where it comes in.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:03.020
So now I can see that if I
raise the pressure in my

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:09.200
container, raise the pressure,
this is in the denominator, so

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.030
this fraction gets smaller.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.550
Alpha gets smaller.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:22.250
I raise the pressure, the
fraction of material that

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.170
reacts gets smaller.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:30.480
Therefore, the reaction goes
towards the reactants.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:38.160
If I decrease the pressure, this
is a smaller number here.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.500
The fraction gets bigger.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:40.990
Alpha goes up.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:47.210
If I decrease the pressure and
I compare what happens to the

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:51.320
number of moles of reactants
that react, more of it reacts.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.140
Equilibrium shifts towards
the product.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:02.680
And this is Le Chatelier
that you already know.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:10.480
Le Chatelier's principle,
for pressure.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.860
The way it works is that Le
Chatelier's principle states

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:23.050
that, this chemical system wants
to stay as close to what

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:23.820
it was before.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.620
It doesn't like change.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.030
It doesn't want to have
any change happen.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:34.280
So if you increase the pressure,
the chemical system

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.320
says, hey, you know I'm not so
happy that you're increasing

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.860
the pressure on me.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.030
I'd like to go back to
a smaller pressure.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.020
It doesn't like change.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.780
Very conservative.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.760
And the way to decrease the
pressure is to decrease the

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.230
number of moles in
the container.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.140
How does it decrease the
number of moles?

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.590
Goes back to where there
are fewer moles.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:03.870
And that's on the
reactant side.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.450
How many of you know
Lenz's law?

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.980
In magnetism.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.070
The diamagnetic materials.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:11.830
Right.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.760
At least one person knows it.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.640
It's the same idea.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.880
You take a diamagnetic material
in the absence of a

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.820
magnetic field, and you slowly
move it into a place where

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.920
there's high magnetic field,
what does the diamagnetic

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.110
material do?

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.680
It orients its magnetic moment
to reverse the field.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.160
So that there's no
field inside.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.740
It starts out with no field.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.640
Doesn't like change.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.590
So Lenz's law says it's going to
do whatever it can so that

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.450
it retains no field inside.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.790
Le Chatelier's principle is
basically the same thing.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.100
Equilibrium systems are
very unhappy if you

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.330
try to change them.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.950
And that's what happens for Le
Chatelier here with pressure.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.790
Any questions?

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.660
So before we go to Le
Chatelier's with temperature,

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.570
and the van 't Hoff equation.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:11.290
Let's do a little detour here
and talk about equilibrium in

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.960
solution, which is really as
important, or if not important

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.430
for a lot of you, then gas
phase equilibrium.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.320
Although gas phase equilibrium
was where everything started.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.860
And still a huge deal.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:32.330
OK, so in equilibrium now, when
we talk about equilibrium

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.290
in solution, we still have
to, still going to be

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.870
the chemical potential.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.680
It's still going to be looking
at how chemical potential

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.530
likes to go downhill.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:46.730
And we're going to have to write
chemical potential for a

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:51.140
species, A, let's say,
which is in solution.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.920
At some concentration
c sub A in solution.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:03.860
And the concentration could be
given in moles per liter.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.510
Or it could be in
grams per liter.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:13.910
Or it could be in grams
per 1000 grams.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.860
Whatever your favorite unit
of concentration is.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.740
Use it.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.210
Stick to it.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.260
And in order to do equilibrium,
we're going to

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:28.360
have to reference it to, so this
would be the species at

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.280
some arbitrary concentration.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.110
We're going to have to reference
it to some reference

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.730
concentration.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.210
Just like we referenced
everything to one bar before,

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.920
as our standard pressure.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.860
And we're going to take, usually
you take one mole per

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.690
liter, or one gram per liter,
or one whatever.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.750
One as your reference
concentration.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.220
And the reference concentration
is going to

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.460
disappear from the equation.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.140
It's just like the reference
pressure.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.100
Disappear from the equation.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.320
So we're going to reference this
to some standard state

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.580
chemical potential.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.390
Where the naught refers now to
the standard concentration.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:12.245
And instead of having RT
log p, now we're going

00:17:12.245 --> 00:17:16.500
to have RT log cA.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.390
It's kind of like considering
the molecules in the solution

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:26.240
to act like an ideal gas.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.730
Knowing fully well that behind,
that underneath the

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:33.280
cA, is this reference
concentration of one.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.960
One whatever is your
favorite units.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.230
Now, it's a little bit
more complicated than

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.420
for the ideal gas.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:48.550
Because your solution may
contain other things than your

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.740
reactants and your products.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.920
Especially if you're
doing biology.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.430
It could be a buffer.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.390
It could be a buffer,
it could have salt.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:00.160
It could have a pH that's not
equal to seven, whatever.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.060
And so this reference, chemical
potential, now needs

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:12.380
to be referenced to a particular
pH or salt

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.120
concentration.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:20.280
Or whatever the properties
of your solvent are.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.240
Or your solution are.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.660
And that's the big difference.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.980
In an ideal gas, it's

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.870
reference to vacuum, basically.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.090
There's nothing there.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.340
In here, in solution you have
all these molecules of

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:38.000
solvent, molecules of salt,
molecules of acid, or

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.260
whatever, that are going to be
around to buffer the pH.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.320
And that's going to change what
the chemical potential of

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.370
a species is.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.160
And if I change the pH and I've
got a molecule that I'm

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.500
interested in, it may not have
an acidic moiety on it, but it

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.660
could still care what
the pH is, slightly.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.990
And that would change what the
reference potential is,

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.920
chemical potential is.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.540
So this is really important
to remember.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.640
And there are textbooks that are
written on how to do this

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.090
the right way.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.110
We're not going to
do that here.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.020
We're just going to remember
this is, we're going to assume

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.290
that this is done correctly.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:20.360
Once you take that as a given,
that you have a way to have a

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.630
reference chemical potential
at a properly referenced pH

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.520
and salt concentration, then
you can go through the same

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.740
analysis that we went to
for partial pressures.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:34.590
This looks just like the ideal
gas, where the concentration

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.130
replaces the partial pressure.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:43.360
Or the pressure of chemical A.
And you can go through, then

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:52.440
the same argument, where
you take your reaction.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:20:00.370
And you initially have some
delta G for the reactants.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:05.420
And you have some delta
G for the products.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.830
And the difference is the delta
G for the reaction,

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:17.110
delta G naught for the reaction,
and then on this

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:26.510
side here, you have a solution
of A, so the reaction would be

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.390
nu A times A, which
is in a solution.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.980
Temperature and pressure.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.910
Plus nu B of reactant
B, in a solution,

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.340
temperature and pressure.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.330
Going to a nu C, C solution,
temperature and pressure plus

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.560
nu D, D in a solution, constant

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.230
temperature and pressure.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.420
So this is taking a solution
of A, in one container, a

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.150
solution of B in another
the container.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.360
That's the initial point.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:57.970
Mix them together.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.690
Let them react.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.580
Then you take the product,
you put them in separate

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.640
containers.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.770
And that gets you the stuff that
you have the reaction.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.980
So when you mix A and B, you're
going to have the same

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.980
entropy of mixing.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.100
You're going to lower the delta
G. Of the solution.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.640
And you're going to have
the same curve that

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.530
goes down like this.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.890
To the mixture of products.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.630
And just like for the gases,
where we wanted to know what

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.360
is the bottom of this curve
which gives us the

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.480
equilibrium, we can
do the same thing.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.110
Exactly the same thing,
for solutions.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:37.050
And so we start out with a
mixture of the A and B in

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.470
solution and C and D, reactants

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.070
and products together.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:45.650
And we let the reaction
proceed a little bit.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:53.030
And we look at the change in
delta G, going from, say this

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.130
point here through
that point here.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.570
This will be delta
G of epsilon.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.600
We ask, is this positive,
negative, or zero.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.100
And if it's zero, that means
that we're in equilibrium,

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.150
that we're actually
sitting down here.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.420
And that gives us the
equilibrium constant.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.280
So, just for the sake of
completeness, let me just

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.730
write down what we would do.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.240
We would react it for
a small amount.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.530
And then we'd end
up with nu C.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.050
So you would have the chemical
potentials of the products

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:33.480
minus the chemical potentials
of the reactants, nu C mu C,

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:44.160
plus nu D mu D, minus nu A mu
A, minus nu B mu B. And

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.680
instead of these chemical
potentials, you would write

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:51.130
them in terms of the pure
chemical potentials times

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:55.630
their concentrations.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:01.470
And then you'd end up with
epsilon times delta G naught

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:10.360
of the reaction, plus RT log,
and then the concentrations.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.450
And then you write them
in a different way.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:15.380
So if it's moles per liter, you
usually write that with

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.240
these brackets here.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.940
That means concentration of A
in moles per liter, I'd say.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:29.420
So C to the nu C power, D to the
nu D power, A to the nu A

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.110
power, and B to the nu
B power, in these

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.370
concentrations.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.420
Where this ratio of logs comes
from expanding out the

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.380
chemical potential here.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.750
And there's the log term here.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.670
Just like an ideal gas.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.070
Then at equilibrium, this is
equal to zero, you're at the

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.620
bottom of that curve.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.350
And you set these two things
equal to each other.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:04.880
And you get the chemical,
you get your equation

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.200
that you know well.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.550
For the equilibrium constant.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:16.050
And this time it's not K sub
p, it's just K. And that's

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.700
what you know from doing
solution equilibrium.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.390
And it's just like V.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:28.810
So the thing to remember, which
is the slightly more

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.520
advanced part, which you'll have
to worry about at some

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.820
point if you stay in some sort
of biochemistry oriented

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.060
field, is that you've got to
reference your initial

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.340
solution properly.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:48.150
To get to the right equilibrium
constant.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:53.960
OK, any questions?

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.260
Alright, then now we can do the
temperature dependence of

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.900
the equilibrium constant
in a general way.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.260
Whether it be a gas
or a solution.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.160
It doesn't matter.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:13.970
It's going to be
the same thing.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.080
So the question that we ask now
is, suppose that I change

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.320
the temperature of my
equilibrium, which way is the

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.990
equilibrium going to shift?

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:28.580
And you all know the answer
already, probably.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.010
But let's derive it out.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.010
So we're going to want to know
basically, we want to know

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.260
what is dKp/dT.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.850
How does equilibrium constant,
or dK/dT, if you're doing

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.150
solution, how does the
equilibrium change with

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.230
temperature?

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.880
What's the slope?

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.090
Is it positive, negative?

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.350
If we have this, we can
integrate it out.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.560
We can do an integral
over temperature.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.380
And get an actual change.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.540
So that's our goal.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.670
To find how the equilibrium
constant changes with

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.350
temperature.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.220
What do we know?

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:11.640
Well, we know how Kp depends
on temperature, through the

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.740
Gibbs free energy
of the reaction.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.780
The Gibbs free energy, delta
G naught, has a temperature

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.060
dependence.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.700
And then there's an RT sitting
on the bottom.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.890
There's another temperature
dependence here.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.000
Well, dKp/dT is sort of like,
we could also ask

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.990
what's d log Kp dT.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:30.500
That might be an easier
question.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.810
It's basically the
same question.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.010
Especially since we have
something which is log K, is

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:35.830
equal to something.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.320
So let's ask this question
instead.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.580
Let's ask, what is
d log Kp dT?

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:48.380
Alright, so let's differentiate
both sides.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:54.880
d/dT, d/dT here.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.950
Got to use the chain rule now.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:58.490
Because we've got temperature
as part of

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:04.270
delta G Write it out.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.930
So let's take the derivative
with respect to the

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.180
temperature on the
bottom first.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.710
We have delta G naught, which is
a function of temperature,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.100
divided by RT squared.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.250
The minus sign here disappears
when you take the derivative

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:18.960
on the bottom.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:30.160
Minus one over RT, d/dT
of delta G naught.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:36.840
So this is a derivative
of delta G, where zero

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.370
means here one bar.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.210
Fixed at one bar.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:46.490
So really, d/dT, with delta G
naught fixed on one bar, is

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.130
the same thing as the partial
derivative of delta G with

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.605
respect to temperature, keeping
p is equal to constant

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:55.650
at one bar.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:28:01.620
It's the same thing, just
different notation.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.530
And we know what this is.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:12.540
In terms of other things that
we can find in books, like

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.960
delta H, or delta S. Because
we can go to

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.900
the fundamental equations.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:27.370
To find out how delta G depends
on temperature.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.170
And our goal is to get rid of
delta G, which clearly has a

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.790
nice temperature dependence
through the entropy term.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.510
And to replace delta G with
delta H, if we can.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.750
Because delta h is going to
be much less sensitive to

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:43.390
temperature and it's, delta H
is going to be over small

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:44.700
temperature ranges, is going
to be independent of

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.100
temperature.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.380
And we know the temperature
dependence of delta H, because

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.020
it's through the heat
capacities.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:55.150
So our goal is to get rid
of this delta G here.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:59.430
And to try to replace it with
delta H, if at all possible.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:04.260
So we go to the fundamental
equation for G, dG is equal to

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:10.100
minus S dT plus V dp.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:17.800
And sitting right here is
dG/dT at constant p.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.940
Which is what we have here.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:25.110
So we get rid of this derivative
of G. And replace

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:35.890
it with S. So now, now we have
d log Kp dT, and I mentioned

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:38.890
already that I want to get rid
of G. Because it has a strong

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:39.680
temperature dependence.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.490
And I want to somehow get H in
there, which is not going to

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.130
have a strong temperature
dependence.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.625
And delta G naught, I can write
in terms of H and S, and

00:29:47.625 --> 00:29:56.410
T. Delta H naught minus
T delta S naught

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.630
divided by RT squared.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:04.800
And then my derivative here,
I have minus one over RT.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.890
Partial of G with respect to
T. p is equal to one bar.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:13.080
Well, that's just delta S. p
is equal to one bar, well,

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.260
that's just delta S naught.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:20.660
Times delta S naught.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.800
And that's great, because
now there's minus T

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.920
divided by RT squared.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.080
That's one over RT.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.340
And somewhere I've
lost a sign.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.300
And there's my sign that
I lost, right there.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:40.580
This minus sign here. d/dT of
delta G naught is minus S. It

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.000
actually includes this minus
sign right here.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.650
Which is great, because now
things work out, because this

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:49.090
becomes a plus sign.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:54.460
And this and this cancel out.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:31:03.380
And this becomes delta H
naught over RT squared.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.300
Great, so we have
what we want.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.320
We have how the equilibrium
constant depends on

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.050
temperature in a way which
is very clear.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.110
Where the top part is only
very weakly dependent on

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.740
temperature, usually.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:23.160
And this is called the
van 't Hoff equation.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.900
And this will tell us what
happens to equilibrium when we

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.340
change the temperature.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.710
So if you want to do a finite
temperature change, now what

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:52.700
you need to do is, you
need to integrate.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:59.320
You integrate both sides here.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.520
From some T1 to T2.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:09.880
From T1 to T2, and that tells
you, then, that the log of the

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.480
equilibrium constant at the new
temperature is equal to

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.650
the log of the equilibrium
constant of the old

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:21.310
temperature, T1, plus the
integral from T1 to T2 of

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:28.180
delta H over RT delta H naught,
over RT squared.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.690
And this could be slightly
temperature dependent. dT.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.810
And this is the integrated
van 't Hoff equation.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.480
And if you're going to be
designing a chemical plant

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.810
where you have high temperatures
and high

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:48.070
pressures around, you
better use that.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.070
Because there is some
temperature dependence in

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.150
delta H, through the heat
capacities of the reactants

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.460
and the products.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.880
And that could make the
difference between your plant

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.750
running nice and smoothly
or your plant exploding.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.210
And you don't want to have
exploding plants around.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:10.160
So for heavy-duty uses of this
equation, you've got to do the

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.800
integral properly.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.830
But for most normal
applications, like if you're

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.030
doing biology, where the
temperature changes by a few

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.730
degrees, like today I have
a little bit of a cold.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.500
I don't have a fever, but
I could have a fever.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.050
So my biochemistry would change
if I had a fever.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:27.420
The equilibrium constant of all
my reactions would change

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.820
a little bit.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.350
It's a small change
in temperature.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.640
I'm not going to explode.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.330
And so you can then take
the approximation.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:47.140
In that case, the delta H
naught, is independent of T.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:53.960
And this is fine over small
temperature ranges.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.940
And that's the one that
you're most used to.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.770
Is this approximation
here, this

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.020
approximate van 't Hoff equation.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.860
Which is really fine for most
cases that you're going to be

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.870
dealing with.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.190
So then, if that's the case then
you can take your delta

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:12.830
H. Ignore the temperature
dependence and take it outside

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.210
of the integral.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:17.370
And now you can do the
integral fine.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:21.190
And then you have an analytic
expression for the change in

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:23.600
the equilibrium constant
with temperature.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:29.170
Log Kp at a new temperature, T2,
is log Kp temperature T1.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.610
And I'm carrying this little
p around everywhere.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.410
But really, it doesn't
have to be there.

00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:35.180
This could be solution.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:38.450
I shouldn't really have written
this for the specific

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:40.240
case of partial pressures.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.090
But it's equally valid
for solutions.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:46.970
Then we have delta H naught over
R. And then we have the

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:51.430
integral from T1 to T2, over
one of RT squared.

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:53.520
And if you do that the
right way, you get T2

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.610
minus T1 over T1 T2.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.020
And that gives you the

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.280
approximate van 't Hoff equation.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.480
Which is fine.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.080
And you'll know that it's fine
in problem sets or exam,

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.450
because we'll say assume that
delta H is temperature - yes.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:18.940
STUDENT: You said that
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.740
PROFESSOR: For K, if
K is solution K.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.260
STUDENT: Right.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:23.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.930
STUDENT: So then, can
you also use Kx?

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.450
PROFESSOR: Can you use Kx?

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:33.140
Well, as long as you keep the
pressure, the total pressure,

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:38.720
constant, then you should
be able to use Kx.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.920
Let me think about this.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.100
Yeah, here you would have p, you
have a log c so, you can

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:47.840
use Kx, fine.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.560
Because then you would have log
p to the minus delta nu

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.890
times Kx, log p to the
delta nu minus Kx.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.770
And the log of the
multiplication is

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.380
the sum of the logs.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.440
And the logs will
just fall out.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.460
So it could be any
K that you want.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.080
Doesn't matter.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.190
As long as you keep the
pressure constant.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:10.630
If you change the pressure,
then you're in trouble.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:14.660
So now we can see what happens
when you do change the

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.280
temperature.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:25.420
If I have some equilibrium, and
it's all going to depend

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.020
on the sign of delta H. Whether
the reaction is

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:33.200
exothermic or endothermic.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.340
And it's the same thing as Le
Chatelier's for pressure, or

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.090
Lenz's law.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.300
The system doesn't want to
have change happening.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.430
So if you have something that's,
delta H is less than

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:46.810
zero, it's exothermic.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:51.750
Exothermic, that means that
it's putting out heat. it

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.300
wants to heat up its
environment.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.990
And if I take temperature and
I raise the temperature, the

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.130
system's not going to
like that very much.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:06.540
It doesn't want to get hotter,
and going from reactants to

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.550
products makes things hotter.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:09.520
And if you go from products to

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.980
reactants, that's the opposite.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.840
Go from reactants to products,
that becomes endothermic.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.420
It sucks in heat.

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.610
You raise the temperature.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.210
The system said no, no, no,
I'm happy where I am at my

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:20.450
original temperature.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.960
I'm going to start sucking in
heat, to try to get the

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.810
temperature down.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.630
And it's going to try to
make more product.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.250
More reactants.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:40.170
So, equilibrium K is going to go
down. and the reaction goes

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.810
towards the reactants.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:46.090
And the opposite if you have
something that's endothermic

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:49.670
to begin with.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.230
OK, delta H is positive here.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:54.650
Delta H naught is positive.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.850
You raise the temperature, delta
H naught is positive,

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:58.590
T2's bigger.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.620
This is a positive number.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:06.910
K becomes larger at higher
temperature.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.850
K goes up.

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:10.900
The reaction goes to products.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:15.210
So if you think of it in terms
of the system, the system is

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.960
at some temperature.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.820
You raise the temperature.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.500
System doesn't like it.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.910
Says, I want to go back
to my original

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.520
temperature, what can I do.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.690
I can try to suck in heat that
you're trying to put in the

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:28.970
environment.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:31.630
That's great because if I make
more products, that's

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.730
endothermic.

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:34.810
And I'm just going to make more
products until I try to

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:35.740
lower my temperature.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:41.740
So I move the equilibrium
to the products.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:56.130
OK, Le Chatelier for
temperature.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.910
Any questions?

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:08.300
On equilibrium.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.970
OK, let's do a quick example.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:13.410
Because this was the example
that we started out with,

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.760
talking about, the
Haber process.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:21.570
This important industrial
reaction that started the

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:23.670
chemical industry,
essentially.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.860
That uses up 1%, or close to
1%, of the world's energy.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.740
If you think about it, that's
an amazing number.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.960
1% of all energy
produced in the

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.110
world goes to one reaction.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.050
One industrial reaction.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:45.430
Just shows how important
it is.

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.210
OK, why does it take
so much energy?

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:48.260
We're going to find out.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:55.310
We're going to find out why it
takes so much energy to run

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.500
this here reaction.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.100
Alright, let's look at
this Haber process.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:04.990
Take some nitrogen gas.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:11.270
Plus some hydrogen gas.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:14.380
And this is usually done over
catalysts, like an iron oxide

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.850
catalyst or something.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.090
To try to speed it up.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:18.330
It doesn't change the
thermodynamics.

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:22.070
As you know, and you'll hear
again in this class, catalysts

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.140
just affect the kinetics.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.330
They don't change the
thermodynamics.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.950
So this is usually done over
some catalyst to try to

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.220
speed things up.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.450
To make ammonia.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:35.200
And ammonia becomes the
feedstock for fertilizers, for

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.310
almost anything that contains
an amine in it, or

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.680
a nitrogen in it.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.090
If you're going to make
proteins or whatever.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:45.740
You've got to have ammonia
somewhere in the process.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.470
OK, delta H naught of the
reaction, we're given all

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.210
these numbers.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:54.630
At 298 degrees Kelvin.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:57.080
And they're in your notes, so
I'm not going to go through

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.390
them in detail.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:59.890
Delta G naught for
the reaction,

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.940
we're given that number.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:06.810
At 298 degrees Kelvin, that's
minus 16, roughly minus 16

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:12.340
kilojoules per mole.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.500
And we want to know, what is
the equilibrium constant.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.430
Room temperature.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.880
So you know how to
calculate that.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.760
Minus RT log Kp, log K
is equal to minus RT.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.110
Minus delta G naught over RT.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.340
So you put that in there.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.530
You get Kp is equal to 860.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:35.170
A number, no units.

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:36.820
It's a big number.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.800
It's a big number, you've
got the products

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.500
divided by the reactants.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.450
It means that the products
are favored.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:45.160
This is great.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.760
What a wonderful reaction.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.340
Shouldn't take energy to for
us to do that, right?

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.090
It's a room temperature
reaction.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.560
Thermodynamics is great.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.570
But even over a catalyst, this
is a really, really, really

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.230
slow reaction.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:04.590
We'd still be waiting here for
Mr. Haber to produce his first

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:08.190
mole of amine, if you were doing
it, or ammonia if we

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.040
were doing it at room
temperature.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.770
It's just so slow.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.380
Thus, not at all practical.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.620
We're not going to run the
world on room temperature

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:23.840
Haber process.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.710
But it turns out, if you raise
the temperature, kinetics is

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:29.240
wonderful in terms of the
temperature dependence.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.180
It's exponential.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.620
Arrhenius rate law.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.970
Great thing, you raise the
temperature by a little bit.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.190
Rates speed up, things
go faster.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.750
So if you were to raise the
temperature from 298 degrees

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:49.050
Kelvin to 800 degrees Kelvin,
the rate speeds up.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:50.540
You're going to need
some energy.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.620
As input here, to feed that.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.510
Hence the 1% energy use.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.750
Rate speeds up, that's great.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.030
Things happen faster.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.930
It becomes practical.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:04.600
But, what happens if you
raise the temperature?

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:04.910
Let's see.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:09.380
This is an endothermic, or
exothermic, negative sign.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.740
And negative sign's
exothermic.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.780
I raise the temperature,
K goes down.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.590
I know how to calculate
it here.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.090
And if I want to be super
careful, because it's a fairly

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.420
large temperature range, I can
even use the exact form of the

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.280
van 't Hoff equation.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:27.110
And what I find, if I do that,
and putting the heat

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.190
capacities for all these
gases, I find

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.150
that Kp does go down.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.310
In fact, it goes down
quite a bit.

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:39.050
It becomes 0.0007.

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:40.580
Two zero's.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.350
Still really small.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:45.560
That's not practical.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.510
Not practical at all.

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:49.440
No good.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.810
We can't run an industrial plant
with this kind of yield.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.290
There's just no way it's
going to work.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:59.190
So, you're a chemical
engineer.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:01.350
Or a chemist, like Haber
and Bosch were.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:05.510
And you're trying, you know by
Le Chatelier, you know that it

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.310
went in the wrong direction
for you here.

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:10.070
And then you look at your
reaction and you say, how many

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.180
moles of reactants do I have?

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:15.860
3/2 plus 1/2, that's two
moles of reactants.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.040
And I've got one mole
of product.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.600
Two moles reactants, one
mole of product.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.720
Two moles reactant...

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.060
What happens if I change
the pressure?

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.040
If I change the pressure, if I
increase the pressure, the

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.480
system is going to say,
no, I don't want

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.050
the pressure increased.

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.520
It's going to go to where
there's less moles.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.070
And the less moles in
the product area.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.420
It's going to go
to my product.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.020
That's great.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.710
I've got to increase
the pressure.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.220
Wonderful.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.710
Let's start increasing
the pressure.

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.710
Again, we need some
energy to do that.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.380
We're going to go from one bar
to some higher pressure.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.020
It's going to make our lives
more complicated.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.390
The plant might explode now.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:50.890
If the pressure's too high.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:53.230
All sorts of problems going
to come into play.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.660
But, let's do it.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.790
Let's increase the pressure.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:10.280
So, you increase the pressure
from one bar to 100 bar.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:18.160
And you calculate Kx.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.420
Which is really what you want.

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:24.730
So Kx, in this case here,
is equal to p times Kp.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:25.770
Kp doesn't change.

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:27.590
Kp doesn't care what the
total pressure is.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:29.190
It's Kx that cares.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.800
At one bar, Kx is equal Kp.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.050
Kx is p to the minus delta nu.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:40.130
Number of moles of products
minus the number of reactants.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:47.950
If I go from one bar to 100
bars, Kx goes from 0.007 to

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:53.320
100 times 0.007, which
is equal to 0.7.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.970
That's a lot better.

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:58.340
Kx is the mole fraction
or the, of

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.860
products divided by reactants.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:09.220
And if I go to p is equal to 300
bars, then Kx goes to 2.1.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.960
three times 0.7.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.870
This is great.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.630
Now I'm really starting
to make good products.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:16.670
But I've got to go to 300 bar.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:22.300
I've got to go to 300 bar,
and 800 degrees Kelvin.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.500
That is incredibly
energy-intensive.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.330
But it works.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.170
That's why Haber and Bosch
made this work.

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:32.500
And why Germany stayed in the
war longer than after 1916.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.180
The first world war.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:39.840
Ended in 1918.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.240
Nobel Prizes.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.910
Merck, Bayer, all these
german companies.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:48.770
Because they figured how to do
this at high pressure and high

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:49.510
temperature.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:54.450
Without blowing everything up.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:55.910
OK.

00:46:55.910 --> 00:47:01.710
Any questions?

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:02.000
Alright.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.560
The last topic is, so far we've
seen equilibria where

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.770
you had things that
were well mixed.

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.470
equilibria of ideal gases.

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:14.730
Or in solutions, where your
solutes, your solute molecules

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:17.440
are mixing around.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:20.590
And the entropy of mixing was
really super important.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:23.260
Our curve, our going down for
delta G, was all because of

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:24.440
the entropy of mixing.

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.610
Now, suppose that I have a
heterogeneous mixture.

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:32.230
I've got some solids or some
pure liquids that are refusing

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.930
to share their environment.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.680
And staying as pure materials.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:43.870
So, for instance, if I have
a beaker with some solid

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:45.770
reactant on the bottom here.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:55.080
And the products are
in solution.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.440
How do I deal with
that equilibrium?

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.030
Well, you know the answer, but
let's just do it out again.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:04.470
So we're going to have nu
A moles of A, of solid.

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.270
Not mixed in the solution.

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:08.400
Let's say we have multiple
phases here.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.980
Nu B moles of B,
which is a gas.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.760
Instead of a solution, let's
do a gas phase reaction.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.540
Nu C moles of C, which
is a pure liquid.

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:22.020
And nu D moles of D,
which is a gas.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.280
So these two gases can mix.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.580
But the pure solid and the
pure liquid can't mix.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.650
So let's think again, where
does the equilibrium

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:29.460
constant come from?

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:34.310
It comes from looking at this
delta G of the mixture and

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:36.210
letting it react a
little bit more.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:39.905
And taking out these chemical
potentials for the species and

00:48:39.905 --> 00:48:40.750
the mixture.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:46.460
Expanding it out in terms of
log p or log concentration.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.360
So we need to have
this delta G in.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.100
Let's take epsilon equal
to one, to make our

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:51.800
life simpler here.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:57.740
So now we have nu C
mu C of the pure.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.350
The pure solid.

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:04.740
Plus nu D mu C of the gas.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.150
Which is in the mixture.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:14.220
Minus nu A mu A of the
pure liquid, minus nu

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:17.860
B mu B of the gas.

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.200
Which is in the mixture.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.190
That's what this delta G is,
when we allow the reaction to

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:27.380
proceed for a little bit more.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.300
We add a little bit of chemical

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.890
potentials from the products.

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:32.210
Subtract a little
bit of chemical

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:34.370
potential from the reactants.

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:37.330
And then we expand it out in
terms of the standard chemical

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:39.950
potentials for everything
being pure.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:41.720
Entropy of mixing
comes in here.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.610
Comes in here.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:46.300
Delta G of mixing
comes in here.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:54.860
And we end up with something
that looks like nu C mu C

00:49:54.860 --> 00:50:02.760
naught, plus nu D mu D naught,
minus nu A mu A naught, minus

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.670
nu B mu B naught.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:11.730
Plus RT log, and the only place
where we have these log

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:14.590
p's, or log concentration
coming in, is for those

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:17.640
species that were not pure.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.930
And those are only these
two guys here.

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.340
The ones that are in
the gas phase.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:26.820
D and B. So we end up with
partial pressure of D to the

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:27.770
nu D power.

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:32.500
Partial pressure of B,
to the nu B power.

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.560
The other two species
don't come in there.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.630
Because they started
out as pure.

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:39.360
There's no mixing going on.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:44.060
And there's no expansion
of the log for them.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:49.985
And so now, when we look at the
Q for the reaction, the

00:50:49.985 --> 00:50:52.010
reaction quotient, it
doesn't contain

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:53.050
any of the pure species.

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:56.950
It only contains those species
that are allowed to mix.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:51:00.440
Those that are in the gas
phase or in solution.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:08.350
And so K, then, for this
reaction only takes in those

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:14.780
products like D. Or reactants
like B, which

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.380
are in the gas phase.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.170
The pure solids or pure
liquids don't come in.

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:19.640
They come in for
delta G naught.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.090
There's delta G naught
sitting right here.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:26.850
Delta G naught for
the reaction is

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:28.650
sitting right there.

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:32.365
So when you write your log K
is equal to minus delta G

00:51:32.365 --> 00:51:36.940
naught over RT, the delta G
naught has everything in it.

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:40.710
The pure stuff, the solution
stuff, the gas phase stuff.

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:44.570
But the K only has the gas
phase and solution stuff.

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:49.560
Alright, any questions?

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:49.760
Good.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.900
Next time we'll do an example.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.130
And then we'll go on
phase transitions.
