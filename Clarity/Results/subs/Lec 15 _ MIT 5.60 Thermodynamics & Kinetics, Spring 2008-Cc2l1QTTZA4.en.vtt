00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.790
PROFESSOR: So let's start with
some of the things we

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.850
learned last time.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:49.280
So there are two things
that were important.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.710
We learned that the chemical
potential for a species is the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.140
Gibbs free energy for that
species divided by the number

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.800
of moles, this is Gibbs
free energy per mole.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.050
We learned that the pressure
dependence of the Gibbs free

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.270
energy gives you the pressure
dependence for

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.070
the chemical potential.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.960
That it's equal to the chemical
potential at one bar

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.700
for an ideal gas
plus RT log p.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:33.270
We also learned that a species
will want to go to minimize

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.280
its chemical potential, and we
saw that for the cell bursting

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.610
in salt, in distilled water.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.470
Or an ice cube melting
at a temperature

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.700
greater than 0 degrees.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.200
And what we want to prove right
now is that if I take a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.430
species A, in a mixture, some
temperature T, some pressure

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.190
p, and I compare its chemical
potential to the same species,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.760
A, when it's pure, the same
temperature, the same

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.590
pressure, what I want to argue
is that the chemical potential

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.830
in the mixture is always less
than the chemical potential

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.650
when it's pure.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.230
The same conditions of pressure
and temperature.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.380
And, so we can do a little
thought experiment.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.540
Let's do a little thought
experiment.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.140
Let's make a box, and
in our box we're

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.410
going to have a partition.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.540
And a flexible membrane here.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.350
And on one side of the partition
we're going to have

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.760
a gas, B. A gas, A,
on this side here.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.730
And gas A on this side here.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.630
So let me just red chalk for
A, And I don't think I have

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.670
any other colors listed.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.150
Yellow chalk for B here.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.850
And everything's one bar.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.700
Everything's one bar.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.520
So one bar B here.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.160
One bar A here, one
bar A here .

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:25.980
And this membrane here
only lets A through.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.240
And this membrane is deformable,
but it's elastic.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.440
You can't deform it forever.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.920
It has some strength
to it, right?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.360
So if you push on,
it'll push back.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.350
There'll be pressure associated
with that.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.180
So the next thing I do, then,
in my experiment, shouldn't

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.010
have done it here.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.660
Next thing I do in my experiment
is to break this

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.940
partition here.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.920
I'm going to break
the partition.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.550
And this will cause
A and B to mix.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:07.760
So now in my box I have my
partition, my membrane here.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.910
I've got A at one bar here,
total pressure of one bar.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.970
And on the other side I have A
plus B, with a total pressure

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:28.450
of one bar.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.170
That's my initial point now.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.840
What's going to happen?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.860
What's going to happen is that
molecules of A here are going

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.950
to want to go through
the membrane to go

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:40.910
in this area here.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.230
And there's two ways
to look at it.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.090
You can look at it the
thermodynamic way, which is

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.370
the way that we're going to
want to be looking at it.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.460
Which is that, from what we're
going to prove, is that the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.610
chemical potential in the
mixture is always less than

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.900
for the pure substance.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.600
Here we have a mixture.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.280
One bar.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.290
Here we have the pure substance
at one bar.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.350
So these molecules are going
to look around and say hey,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.680
you know, I'm much
happier here.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.570
And they're all going to want
to go in this area here.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.000
As a result, the volume of this
area, if you want to keep

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.310
the same pressure on both sides,
you're going to deform

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.440
the membrane.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.530
The membrane's going
to get deformed.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.590
It's going to bloat
on that side here.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.750
It's going to cause
an increase in

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.280
pressure on that side.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.210
And the increase in pressure
from the membrane sort of

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.600
deforming and pushing back, is
going to increase until the

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.160
partial pressure of A, here,
equals the pressure of A here.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.980
At which point the flow of A
from either side is going to

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.550
be the same and you're going
to be in equilibrium.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.180
And at that point the chemical
potentials of both sides are

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.460
going to be the same.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.700
So I sort of gave you the other
way of looking at it.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.580
Which is just purely in
terms of pressures.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.650
At equilibrium, the partial
pressure of A here has to be

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.630
the same as the pressure
on this side here.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.000
So that the flow of A on either
side of that membrane,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.580
going from right to left or
left to right is the same.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.960
And that's going to cause
this mixing to happen.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.940
If you look at it from partial
pressure perspective.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.610
But really, it's a chemical
potential idea.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.890
Now, the chemical potential,
as we saw, was

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.280
the Gibbs free energy.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.990
And the Gibbs free energy, you
can write it as H minus TS.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.410
So basically, in this process
that I described, the

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.730
enthalpy's not doing anything.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.730
These are ideal gases.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.370
They're not interacting
with each other.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.980
The only thing that's changing,
that's driving the

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.650
chemical potential, which is
basically Gibbs free energy

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.310
per mole, the only thing that's
driving the chemical

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.850
potential to be lower on
this side here, is

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.440
that entropy term.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.690
It's the entropy of mixing.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.790
So entropy of mixing is really
super important.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.650
When we're talking about
systems where you have

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.910
multiple components.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.470
That's going to drive
a lot of things.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.350
And in fact that's going to
drive equilibrium, as we're

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.310
going to see a little
bit later today.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.100
Alright, let's quickly
go through the math

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.370
and prove this here.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.660
So our goal, then, is to have a
mixture, chemical potential

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.710
of the mixture on one side, and
the chemical potential of

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.310
the pure material on
the other side.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.990
And so we're going to start by
sort of a similar thing here.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:39.090
We're going to have a box, let
me redo my box here, we're

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.080
going to have a box with,
let me get rid of

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.490
these one bars here.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:50.750
We're going to put our
membrane in the box.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.590
And we're going to have
a pressure, pA,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.250
on this side here.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.470
And we're going to have a
pressure pA prime for the

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.790
partial pressure of A. And pB
prime for the partial pressure

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:12.130
of B. And the p total is going
to be pA prime plus pB prime.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.030
And I'm going to see at
equilibrium, I'm going to

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.890
write everything I know
about equilibrium.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.470
At equilibrium, I know that the
partial pressure of A on

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.530
that side here has to be equal
to the pressure of A here.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.100
The partial pressure, the
pressure is basically the

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.130
force of these molecules hitting
that membrane per unit

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.280
time, times the number
of molecules hitting.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.110
So we have the same flux of
molecules going this way, is

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.720
equal to the flux of molecules
going the other way.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:50.180
So at equilibrium, pA
prime equals pA.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:50.860
So.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.060
What else can I say?

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.980
At equilibrium, in terms of
the chemical potentials, I

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.430
know that the chemical potential
of the mixture, mu A

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:07.470
in the mixture, temperature
under pressure p total.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.740
Is equal to the chemical
potential of the pure system,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.570
same temperature under
pressure is p

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.850
sub a on that side.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:21.250
These are the two things that
I know at equilibrium.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.260
So let's start to
turn the crank.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.150
And see if we can come up
with, well, we basically

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.320
already have this.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.180
If we can massage the right side
of our equation so that

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.480
the pressure term,
pA, is p total.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.690
And then we'll have an equation
that will compare the

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.320
chemical potential of the
mixture under the same

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.740
conditions as the chemical
potential of

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.030
A in the pure state.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.590
So, what can we use?

00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:01.600
We can use Dalton's law here,
which tells us that pA prime

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.380
is equal to xA p total.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.700
That's from Dalton.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.780
And now, pA prime
is equal to pA.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.710
So this is also just pA.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:18.780
And we can plug that in here,
and suddenly we've got p total

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.450
included in here.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.630
Let's just pass these out.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:30.160
If you want to, thank you.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:40.450
Thank you.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:50.820
So, this is equal to mu A pure
temperature xA p total.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.730
So what else do I know?

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.280
I know that I've written
something here, that mu is

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.610
equal to mu naught, to temp,
so this is at one bar.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.660
RT log p.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:11.960
So I'm going to rewrite
this as mu A pure

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.230
temperature T at one bar.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:19.940
Plus RT log xA p total.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.340
Now, the log of xA times p total
is the log of xA plus

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.220
the log of p total.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:34.240
It's equal to plus RT log
p total plus RT log xA.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.470
So I can lump these two
things together.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:45.650
I have mu A pure T
plus RT log p.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:52.480
Well, that's just the chemical
potential of A, in the pure

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.520
state, at temperature
T and pressure pT.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.220
That's the equation here to
relate pressure, at some

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.650
variable pressure p, to what
it would be at one bar.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.170
Which is that.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.640
Then we have the plus RT
log xA sitting here.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.490
Plus RT log xA.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.310
So we're done.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.820
We're done because on that side
here I have mu A, the

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:21.600
chemical potential of A in the
mixture, temperature T,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.220
pressure p total.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.270
I've got mu A pure temperature
T pressure p

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.530
total, plus a term.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.420
Plus RT log xA.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.100
Can xA be bigger than one? xA's
the mole fraction. xA's

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.150
always less than one.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.050
Log xA is always
less than zero.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:48.920
This term here is always less
than or equal to zero.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.870
Therefore, this term is always
less than that term.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.850
Therefore the chemical potential
in the mixture is

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.950
always less than the
chemical potential

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:09.320
inside the pure material.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.660
This is going to be important
for the next part of the

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.010
presentation.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.230
Any questions?

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.985
This is what drives the death
of saltwater fish in fresh

00:13:20.985 --> 00:13:22.250
water, right?

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.500
Because osmotic pressure
is basically given by

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.010
this basic idea here.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:38.050
And it's all driven by
entropy of mixing.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:38.960
Sure you don't have
any questions?

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:44.740
Speak up.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.810
So now we have all the tools
we need to look at chemical

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:53.070
equilibrium.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.250
When we have a mixture, and
we're going to start with

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.080
ideal gases.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.550
But everything I'm going to
say about equilibrium and

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.700
ideal gases is valid
for solutions.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.220
An ideal gas, and we're
going to be

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.580
talking about ideal solutions.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.500
And molecules in an ideal
solution, an ideal solvent,

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.680
are not very different than
molecules in an ideal gas.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.320
They don't interact
with each other.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.190
You use concentration instead
of partial pressures, but

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.810
pretty much all the ideas
are the same.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.035
All the concepts are the same.

00:14:22.035 --> 00:14:24.170
The equations are basically
the same.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.110
You just do a little bit of
replacement of variables.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.800
But it pretty much is
the same thing.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.810
It's easier to think about it,
to learn first in terms of the

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:36.830
ideal gas, but it applies
equally well to what you're

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:37.840
more likely to use.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.040
Which is solutions.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.180
So let's look at the
prototypical gas phase

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.900
reaction that everybody writes
down when they first do this

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:52.580
sort of problems.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.980
The Haber process.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.310
Gas, temperature T,
you take nitrogen.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:05.940
You react it with hydrogen,
gas, temperature T, p.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.200
And you make ammonia.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.740
NH3 gas T, p.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:18.900
And we're going to ask the
question, so I take nitrogen,

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.470
I take some, hydrogen, I mix
them together in a container.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:22.710
And I make ammonia.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:27.340
And I'm going to ask, after I
reach equilibrium, what is the

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:36.810
partial pressure of nitrogen
hydrogen and ammonia?

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.320
Standard equilibrium problem.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.740
You all, I'm sure you've all
seen equations about

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.560
equilibrium.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.460
Equilibrium constant K, log
delta G of the reaction, et

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.700
cetera, et cetera.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.330
But you probably don't have a
really good intuition as to

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.350
why it is what it is.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:59.100
So the point of the class here
is not to relearn log K is

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.880
equal to minus delta G, reaction
divided by RT.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.150
The point is to learn
how we get there.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.260
How we get to that equation.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.480
And what parts are important.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.130
Specifically, how entropy of
mixing really becomes key to

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.170
equilibrium.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.260
But before we get there, let
me give you a little bit of

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.340
history as to why this is such
an important reaction.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.870
This reaction, which you see in
every chemistry class, was

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.360
developed by Mr. Haber
and Mr. Bosch.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.410
Mr. Bosch made it large-scale
around 1910.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:38.210
And it's the reaction that you
use to make fertilizer.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.550
Ammonia is the feed stock
to make nitrogen-based

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:44.430
fertilizers.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.780
So today, there are a hundred
million tons of fertilizer, of

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.930
nitrogen fertilizer
made, using,

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.200
essentially, the Haber process.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.820
It's a huge, huge, commodity.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.520
1% of the world's energy
is taken up

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.640
to make this reaction.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.750
Almost 1% is about 3/4
of the world's

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.510
energy is used on this.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:12.120
In World War 1, Germany was
making explosives out of

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.120
nitrogen feed stock.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.060
And it was getting its feed
stock from Chile.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.530
From saltpeter mines in Chile.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.160
Chile was under British
hands at the time.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.590
Well, the British didn't
let Chile sell

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:26.220
saltpeter to Germany.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.190
Germany had to find another
way to make ammunitions.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.210
And the Haber process, which
had just been invented by

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:43.900
Bosch-Haber, became the way that
Germany made explosives.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.700
Without this, Germany would have
stopped the war in 1916.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.580
Or even before then.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:55.170
Way before then.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:03.460
And this process was basically,
and Haber and Bosch

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.020
got the Nobel Prize,
essentially, for this process.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.390
For showing how to take
chemistry, and doing chemistry

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.870
and large scale processes under
high pressure and high

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.180
temperature conditions.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:17.130
Haber got the Nobel Prize in
1918 and Bosch got it in 1931.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:21.300
This process, arguably, you
could say, was the birth of

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.720
the dominance of Germany
as a chemical industry.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.360
Based on that, and the fact that
they had to make liquid

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.940
fuels out of coal.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.750
The syn-gas, or the
syn-fuel process.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.200
Also invented during World War
1, where they had to use, they

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.060
couldn't find any oil and they
had to use their coal mines.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.960
And obviously this process,
the syn-fuel process, is

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.480
coming back in vogue with the
energy crisis around now.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.770
So they developed a lot of
knowledge about how to do

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.090
large-scale chemical
reactions.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:02.400
And that was the birth of, or
the explosion of, companies

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.210
like Merck and Bayer and Bosch,
and BASF, and all these

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.860
German companies that dominate,
basically, the

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.870
chemical industry.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:18.480
And when Germany lost the war,
the US government confiscated

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.390
the American divisions of
these German companies.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.950
And I'm sure you've heard
of Merck as the company.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.610
And you think of Merck
as an American

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.930
company that makes drugs.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:31.720
Well, that's true.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.240
It's a very large American
company that makes drugs.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.110
But there's another Merck, which
is the German Merck.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.610
Which also makes drugs.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.760
But it makes liquid crystals.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.092
And liquid crystals is
where it makes all of

00:19:43.092 --> 00:19:45.110
its money right now.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.410
And it's very confusing because
they're both Merck.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.040
And they both came from the
Merck family from the 1600s

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.470
that were pharmacists.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:20:02.420
But after World War 1, Merck
Germany was allowed to use the

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:07.060
name Merck everywhere in the
world except for the US.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.980
In the US it's called EMD.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.380
Merck USA is allowed to use the
name Merck in the US and

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.820
outside of the US it's called,
let me remind myself, it's

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.460
called MSD.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.840
It's very confusing.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.850
Bayer is the same way.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.560
So Bayer was split up.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.260
And there was Buyer in Germany
and there was Bayer in the US.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.570
You've got Bayer Aspirin
from the US term Bayer.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:31.550
And you've got all the other

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.770
pharmaceuticals from Bayer Germany.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.040
All the chemicals.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.450
And a few years ago, Buyer
bought Bayer, and now we have

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:44.750
one Buyer-Bayer, depending
on where you live.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.060
And so it's very interesting
to see the history of all

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.240
these big chemical companies.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.690
And that's why Switzerland and
Germany are still the home of,

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.390
it's all due to that reaction.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.470
That's why you always
see that reaction.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.520
Fertilizers, at the birth of the
chemical company, and it's

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:06.260
a great example for
equilibrium.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.760
So that's the example.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.680
Let's generalize it.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.250
We're actually not going
to work on this

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.300
until the very end.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.940
And we'll see it again.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.040
But let's generalize.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.480
Let's just take a mixture of
gases with stoichiometries nu

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:27.970
A, a gas, pressure, temperature
plus nu B, B, gas,

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:35.946
pressure, temperature, goes to
nu sub C moles of C, it's a

00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:38.930
gas, with a temperature and
pressure, plus nu sub D moles

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.620
of D, which is a gas,
temperature, pressure.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.610
All ideal gases.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:48.430
For now.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:57.100
So this the setup here.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:04.730
Now, when we write that reaction
up here, what we're

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:11.930
really writing is, in terms
of the process, is take a

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:16.630
container that contains A, plus
a container that contains

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:21.950
B, and go to a container that
contains C, plus a container

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:28.970
that contains D. And when we
write delta G for that

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:34.000
reaction here, the process that
we're talking about is

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.150
taking the reactions separately
from each other.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.830
That's the initial state.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.520
And the final state
is the product.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.090
Separated in their own
containers from each other.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.820
And when we say delta G is
less than zero, for this

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.770
process, which means it's
spontaneous, we mean the

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.300
process to go from the separated
reactions to the

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.000
separated products.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.310
But in reality, that's not what
you do when you do an

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.050
experiment.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.630
In reality, you take these
two containers and

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.020
you mix them together.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.250
A plus B. And you
let that react.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.790
And at the end of the day, you
have a big container with A

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:20.430
plus B plus C plus D inside,
all mixed up together in

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.190
equilibrium.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:30.500
And this is not the
same as that.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.030
It's not the same as that.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:35.070
Because you've got
entropy of mixing

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.760
happening in all of this.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.030
Forget about A and B interacting
with each other.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.780
Entropy of mixing is going
to dominate equilibrium.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:51.060
You've got this problem
to deal with.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.310
So that means that we're going
to have to worry about, if

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:59.430
we're going to want to know at
which state the process is in

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.745
equilibrium, you're going to
have to worry about this issue

00:24:01.745 --> 00:24:03.020
right here.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.470
It's not enough to know what
delta G of the reaction is.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:10.920
So for instance, if I plot, as
function of the reaction, I've

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.810
got the reactants on
that side here.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.830
And the products on
this side here.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.570
And I want to plot delta G as
a function of the reaction.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:28.190
Well, my initial delta G that
I would write, to calculate

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.050
delta G of the reaction, which
is the delta G of the

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:41.520
products, minus the delta G of
the reactants, so initially I

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.110
have delta G of the reactants.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.610
That's, in those two boxes,
that aren't mixed.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.930
So I'm up here somewhere.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:55.470
Delta G of the reactants.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.950
And at the end of the process,
in these two boxes, when I

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.500
calculate this delta G naught
reaction, I'm sitting

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.290
somewhere here.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.590
Let's say it's a downhill
process.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.480
Delta G naught of
the products.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.900
Well, the first thing that
happens, when I take these two

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.760
boxes and mix them together,
is delta G naught of the

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.630
reaction's going to go
up or going to go

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:19.740
down, or stay the same.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.480
Anybody want to guess?

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.030
When I go from here to here,
before there's any reaction

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.330
that happens.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.570
Shall we vote?

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.580
How many say that it's
going to go down?

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.670
How many say that it's
going to go up?

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.830
How many say that it's going
to stay the same?

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.910
We have about three people that
said it's going to go up.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.640
And a lot of people that say
it's going to go down.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.850
And a few people that
are abstaining.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:57.130
OK.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.140
We're mixing things.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.660
Anybody want to change
their votes?

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.170
Something is happening here.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.730
And this entropy term here, when
A and B come together and

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:14.660
start mixing up.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.680
You're changing your vote.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.200
Alright.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.610
It's going to go down.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.380
Now we have near-unanimity.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.850
So the first thing that
happens is, you're

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.140
going to go down here.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.200
You're going to have delta
G naught of the

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:32.870
reactants in the mixture.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.770
And if it were to go all the
way, if A and B were to

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.400
disappear, it still
would be mixed.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.700
And so the end product here
would actually be down here.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.110
It wouldn't be up
in the products.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:48.890
It would be the mixture.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.050
So that's the first
thing we know.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.160
That this delta G naught
reaction is

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.340
not the full story.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.560
And along the way, here I have
two species to begin with.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.140
I've got two species
to end with.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:04.380
But I've got three different
species here in the middle.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:12.150
So as soon as I form a little
bit of products, in this case

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.370
here, or if I start from
products and go the other way

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.000
in the reaction and form the
reactants, the first thing

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.770
that's going to happen is I'm
going to decrease the delta G.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.510
Just from the entropy
of mixing.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:27.940
And so if I plot my delta G
as a function of reaction

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:34.070
conditions, I'm going to get
a bowing curve like that.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:38.050
If the entropy wasn't there,
then it would just be a

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.890
straight line from
one to the other.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.660
The entropy of mixing
of reactants and

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.510
products wasn't there.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.170
Actually, let me
put it up here.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.420
If entropy of mixing wasn't
there, I would

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.990
start from up here.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.140
And as my stoichiometry changed,
I would have a linear

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.520
curve from here to there
as a function of

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.590
the process of reaction.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.410
But the entropy of mixing is
causing my initial state and

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.750
my final state to go down.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.010
And it's causing a
bow in this here.

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:08.330
Because if I have equal amounts
of A, B, C, and D,

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:12.400
that's a lot of entropy
of mixing there.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.990
So equilibrium is actually
somewhere down here.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:20.680
It's where delta G of the
mixture is at its lowest.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.060
Delta G of the mixture
is at its lowest.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:31.650
Any questions?

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.250
Now we going to do the math.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:42.030
We're going to see how
that comes about.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:52.510
Let me do it here.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.780
So the question we're going to
ask is, suppose that I've got

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:56.910
my mixture here.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:02.290
And I'm sitting somewhere
on this curve here.

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:07.240
So I've got pA for partial
pressure of A, partial

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.420
pressure of B, partial pressure
of C, and partial

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.640
pressure of D in my mixture.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.470
And I want to know, I've
got this mixture of

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.760
reactants and products.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.260
Which way is the reaction
going to go?

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.880
Is it going to go towards
the products?

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.420
Is it going to go towards
the reactants?

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.910
Or is it at equilibrium?

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:31.120
And to answer that question, I'm
going to let the reaction

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.200
react a little bit
more to create a

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.870
little bit more products.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.930
Remove a little bit
of reactants.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.500
And see what the sign of delta
G is for that process.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:51.100
So I'm going to go from a moles
of A, b moles of B, c

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.720
moles of C and d moles of D in
my mixture, which is that

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.260
point on my graph here.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.270
Partial pressure A, partial
pressure of B, partial

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.160
pressure of C, and partial
pressure D, and I'm going to

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:13.360
react it a little bit more. a
plus, a minus epsilon times nu

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.830
A, where epsilon is a
very small number.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:25.000
Of A, b minus epsilon times nu
B times B. And I'm going to

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.520
have, now, products being
formed. c moles plus epsilon

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.020
times nu C, I've going to have
the stoichiometry in there.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:37.870
For every nu A moles of A that I
lose, I create mu C moles of

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:42.550
C. Times epsilon as the
scaling factor.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:48.340
And d plus epsilon times nu D
moles of D. That's going to be

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.240
my new mixture.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.700
And I'm going to ask, as I go
from this initial state to

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.380
that final state, I'm sitting
on that curve, which sign is

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.300
delta G. How do I know what
the sign of delta G is?

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.470
What is delta G for
this process?

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.890
Not the reaction with the
isolated reactants and

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.390
products, but the
reaction where

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.870
everything is mixed together.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.470
Where I'm going to have to
worry about the chemical

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.680
potentials of mixtures.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.240
And I'm going to go from one
mixture to another mixture,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.960
and that's going to be the key
to telling me if I'm in

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.420
equilibrium or not.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.690
But we know how to do this.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.050
We know how to do this.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:35.330
So I want to calculate delta G
for the process is delta G

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:39.030
after minus delta G before.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:46.340
That's delta G after minus
delta G before.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:53.390
And I know that delta G, rather,
let's call it G after

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:59.330
minus G before, the Gibbs free
energy after minus the Gibbs

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:01.150
free energy before.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:05.460
And I know the Gibbs free energy
is just the sum of the

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.600
chemical potentials, right?

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.550
You take all the species, and
you take all the chemical

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.070
potentials.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.550
You add it up together times
the stoichiometry.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.420
And that gives you the
Gibbs free energy.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.820
That's what we learned
last time.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.820
So if I want to find what the
Gibbs free energy at the end

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.840
here is, I look at the chemical
potentials of A, B,

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.080
and C and D times their
number of moles.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.310
So I look at a minus epsilon
times nu A times the chemical

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:36.500
potential of A, plus b minus
epsilon times nu B times the

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:41.400
chemical potential of B plus
c, plus epsilon times nu C,

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.860
the chemical potential at C,
plus d, plus epsilon times nu

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:53.510
D, the chemical potential
of D.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:59.660
And then I subtract
what G was before.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.620
This infinitesimally
small process.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:17.050
Was a times mu A plus b times mu
B plus c times mu C, plus d

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:25.150
times mu D. And we're assuming
that my small change, the

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:28.890
small amount of A and B that get
destroyed to form C and D

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:31.070
is small enough that the
chemical potential basically

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.270
stays the same during this
infinitesimally small change.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.250
That's why I can use
the same chemical

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:41.260
potentials before and after.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.150
OK, a lot of things drop out.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.500
This term drops out
from that term.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.060
This term drops out
from this term.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.240
This term drops out
from this term.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.060
This is a minus, no,
this is all plus.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.880
That's fine.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.240
There's the minus
sign right here.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.990
So then this term drops
out from that term.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:09.940
And I am left with epsilon times
nu C mu C, the chemical

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:16.970
potentials of the products minus
the sum of the chemical

00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:29.790
potentials of the reactants,
nu A, mu A plus nu B mu B.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:37.070
That's the delta G for
this small change.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.030
Now, you remember way back,
maybe from even just last

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.980
semester if you've taken 5.112
last semester, or from last

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.770
year, or from high school, that
the partial pressure is

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.130
going to the equilibrium
constant.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.420
Somehow we're going to
have to get partial

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.300
pressures in there.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.170
But we know now how to
go from chemical

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.610
potentials to partial pressures.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.500
It's written right here.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:03.910
The chemical potentials of the,
and we also know how to

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:08.530
go from the chemical potential
in the mixed species, in the,

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:12.900
mixture to the chemical
potential in a pure.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:18.150
We saw that mu A in the mixture,
temperature, pressure

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:24.710
was equal to mu A pure
temperature,

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:29.110
pressure plus RT log xA.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:32.470
So those are things that we're
going to be using, to go from

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.150
something that has chemical
potential to something where

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.390
we'll be able to get back
pressures, partial pressures,

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.510
and delta G of the reaction,
because we're going to need

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:45.730
the chemical potential
of the pure stuff.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:51.970
So let me go forward
just a little bit.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:57.360
Remind you, if I look at the
delta G of the reaction, delta

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.360
G of the reaction, in terms
of chemical potentials.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.630
Delta G naught of
the reaction.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:09.970
This is the delta G of the
products minus the delta G of

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.610
the reactants when they're pure,
not when they're mixed.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:24.900
So delta G naught of the
reaction is nu C mu C at one

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:34.200
bar pure plus nu D mu D pure.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:45.740
Minus nu A mu A pure minus nu
B mu B in the pure state.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.010
That's what delta G naught of
the reaction is in terms of

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:51.190
the chemical potentials
of all these species.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:54.990
Everything's at one bar,
and everything is pure.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:37:06.360
Somehow this is going to have
to come out of this.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.240
So let's keep going.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:17.910
And see how it falls out.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.595
So for each one of these
chemical potentials, I'm going

00:37:20.595 --> 00:37:22.310
to write it in terms
of the pressure.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.550
What I just covered up here.

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:33.290
Mu(T, p) is mu naught
of T times RT log p.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:39.130
So now, delta G is going to be
equal to epsilon, and I'm

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.300
going to do a little
massaging quickly.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.030
And I'll let you take this, go
home and see how I went from

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.910
one state to the other.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:50.260
The secret is to put in here
the pressure dependence.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:38:05.480
Nu C mu C naught, plus nu D mu
D naught, minus nu A mu A

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:19.870
naught, plus nu B mu B naught,
plus RT log pC to the nu C, pD

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:28.820
to the nu D, divided by pA to
the nu A, pB to the nu B.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:34.190
These log partial pressures all
come from expanding out

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:57.910
the chemical potential as
mu naught plus RT log p.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:06.650
And then we recognize that this
part right here, this

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:16.250
part right here is delta
G naught reaction.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:22.120
So I have delta G now, for
this process of taking

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.360
reactants to products just a
little bit, let me take it as

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.740
a function of epsilon here.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:36.070
Delta G naught of the reaction
plus RT log of this ratio of

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.100
partial pressures.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:41.410
I'm going to call that Q. I'm
going to call this thing here

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.480
Q, which you've seen before.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:51.730
The reaction quotient.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:56.050
And this tells me that for
this very small process,

00:39:56.050 --> 00:40:03.310
epsilon, very small, if delta
G naught, delta G, of this

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:09.130
process, is less than zero, then
the reaction will keep

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:09.690
going forward.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.090
It means that I'll be on the
side of the curve here.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.720
I'm going to go down a little
bit. delta G naught is going

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.690
to be great, it's going
to be spontaneous.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.630
I'm not in equilibrium.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:25.810
I'm going to go towards
the products.

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:30.960
If delta G is equal to zero,
then I'm at the bottom of this

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.350
curve here.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.210
I'm here.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.570
If I go forward a little
bit, the slope is zero.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:42.890
Delta G is zero, I'm
in equilibrium.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:50.380
And if delta G is greater than
zero, then I'm going to back

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.800
to reactants, and I'm sitting,
then, on that part of the

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.320
curve here.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.600
And if I try to make more
products I'm just going uphill

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.780
a little bit.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.790
So now, I've done this
all for epsilon is

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:07.900
equal to very small.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.490
What you usually find written in
books is where the epsilon

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:11.260
equals to one.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.420
Basically taking one mole
of this process.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.840
So you'll see it per-mole
of this reaction.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.820
But it's the same idea.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.140
It's the same thing.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.560
And in fact it doesn't really
matter, because the quantity

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.710
that matters is this delta G
naught reactions plus RT log

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.900
Q. It's the sign of this
quantity here.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.630
This epsilon is just an
arbitrary number.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.040
I can pick it, really
whatever I want.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:42.010
So it's the sign of this
thing that's important.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:46.670
Let me go back.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:50.680
So what you'll see, then, is
delta G is equal to delta G

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:58.030
naught reaction plus RT log Q.
Basically, taking epsilon is

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.790
going to zero.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:12.980
As determining where the
equilibrium is going to be.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:20.570
OK, any questions?

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.810
All driven by entropy
of mixing.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:26.350
Without entropy of mixing,
we would be sitting

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:28.720
on this curve here.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.350
Delta G naught of the reaction
would tell us that everything

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.170
should go to completion.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:36.010
Things don't go to completion,
and that's a good thing.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.940
Otherwise there would not
be life on Earth.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.110
We're basically a set of
equilibria in a big membrane.

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:44.840
Which is our skin, right?

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.390
All these biochemical
cycles are in

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:47.460
equilibrium with each other.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.330
And it's a complicated
process.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:52.880
And it's all driven
by entropy.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.570
Ultimately.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:58.560
And other things, but entropy
is very important.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.140
Alright, so equilibrium now.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.060
Equilibrium is when we have this
delta G equal to zero.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:10.520
That's when delta G naught of
the reaction equals RT log Q.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.045
And at that point, we replace Q
with to equilibrium, and we

00:43:15.045 --> 00:43:19.390
call that the equilibrium
constant.

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.940
And we're going to put a little
p here, because it's in

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.520
terms of the partial
pressures.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:32.900
And it's equal to the partial
pressures of the products

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.980
raised to their stoichiometry.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:40.560
And divided by the partial
pressures of the reactants,

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:45.390
raised to the power of
their stoichiometry.

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:48.380
And this, you've seen
before, I'm sure.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:54.140
At equilibrium.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:58.130
And there's a minus sign
somewhere here.

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.730
Because it's this plus that
that's equal to zero, and

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:04.160
there's the minus sign that
I forgot to write down.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.120
So we define, then, equilibrium
constant this way.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:15.370
And one of the things to note is
that Kp as written here is

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:16.340
actually unitless.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.310
It doesn't look like it.

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:19.680
The way that I've written it.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:25.670
Because I did a shorthand way of
writing the pressures, when

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:33.400
I wrote RT log p here.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.560
There's the assumption, when
you have the log of the

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:39.450
pressure, that there's always
one bar sitting behind there.

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:40.370
Underneath.

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:43.080
It's always referenced to
a reference pressure.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.990
There's always a reference
pressure. p naught dividing it

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:51.120
by, because you don't want to
have any units inside the log.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.410
And this reference pressure,
we took as one bar.

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:57.010
And it's pretty common to just
ignore the fact that you've

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:59.940
got one bar sitting in
the denominator.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:04.760
And so, actually, all these
pressures here are divided by

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:10.720
p reference divided by p
reference, divided by p

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.590
reference, divided by
p reference, which

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.740
happens to be 1 bar.

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:17.450
But it's there.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:20.200
And that means that the bars
on top and the bars on the

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.030
bottom cancel out.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.790
Which means that K sub p
doesn't have any units.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:27.040
It is unitless.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.640
It's a number.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.200
Straight number.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:35.880
Very common mistake to make,
to write it and forget that

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.530
there's one bar sitting
on the bottom here.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:40.440
And you take all the bars to the
new powers on top, and the

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.350
bars to the new powers
on the bottom.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.450
And make units there.

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:49.090
And get Kp is equal to some
number, to the, times bar to

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:49.960
some power.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.550
That would be wrong.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.920
I know I've made that
mistake before.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.750
But you are not going to make
that mistake, right?

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:01.720
Because you've been warned.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.280
That this is a common mistake.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.810
This is unitless.

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:11.270
Now, you can invert this to get
Kp as a function of delta

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:16.750
G. e to the minus delta
G naught of the

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:20.380
reaction divided by RT.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.980
And those are the things that
you use to go back and forth

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:27.240
between the thermodynamic
quantities, like G that you

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:31.440
calculate, to equilibrium
quantities like the K, to

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.610
finding equilibria
between something

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:36.830
like the Haber process.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.840
Now, there's other equilibrium
constant that is used a lot.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.200
Which is the form of the
equilibrium constant not in

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.800
terms of the partial pressures,
but in terms of the

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.920
mole fraction.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.950
That's also an important one
when you're looking at

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:54.290
solution cases.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:56.800
Because we can rewrite the
partial pressures using

00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:03.610
Dalton's law. pC is equal to the
mole fraction of species C

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:06.850
times the total pressure,
I'll call it p.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:09.710
So if I replace every one of
these partial pressures using

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:19.120
Dalton's law, I get K sub p is
equal to xC pC times p to the

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:30.710
nu C, times xD pD to the nu D,
divided by xA pA - no, not pA,

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.150
total pressure.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:33.350
Dalton's law.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:39.550
To the nu A, xB p to the nu B.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.930
OK, so I've got p, p, p, p.

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.420
They all come out.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:48.240
And that's p to the
minus delta nu.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.230
Where delta nu is the difference
in the number of

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:55.370
moles of reactants minus the
number of moles of products.

00:47:55.370 --> 00:48:06.710
So delta nu is nu C plus nu D
minus nu A minus nu B. It's

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:10.540
the moles of products minus
moles of reactants.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:16.900
And then I have xA to the nu A,
xC to the nu C, xD to the

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:26.560
nu D, xA to the nu A, xB to
the nu B. And that ratio,

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.170
which is in terms of mole
fractions, we call K sub x.

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:32.680
The mole fractions.

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.380
Because p, to the minus
delta nu, times Kx.

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:44.700
Now, this was unitless.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.430
This pressure to the minus delta
nu sitting here, this

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:50.900
has bars to the minus
delta nu.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.420
Kx has units.

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.420
It may not look like it because
it's a bunch of mole

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.840
fractions, and it certainly
doesn't look

00:48:58.840 --> 00:48:59.830
like it has any units.

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:11.250
Mole fractions or ratio,
but it's got units.

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:20.790
So let's rewrite Kx
in terms of Kp.

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:28.090
Rewrite Kx as equal to p to the
minus delta nu, K sub p.

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:34.240
And the units are in terms of
bars, let's say, bar to the

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.670
minus delta nu.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:39.890
Always want to check your units
at the end of the day.

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:41.710
If your units don't work
out after you've done a

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:48.950
calculation, you're
in trouble.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:49.710
Any questions?

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:51.490
Because we're going to
end today, at here.

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:51.830
Yes.

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:57.070
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:58.680
PROFESSOR: In the
notes it says Kp

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.030
and Kx are both unitless.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.970
That is a mistake.

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:05.480
I'm going to fix that, and
put it on the Web.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:09.050
So it may be that there's a
special case where the number

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:12.140
of moles before and after
are the same.

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.370
But generally that
is not true.

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:19.390
Where did I say that?

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.590
Oh, yeah.

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:24.600
Both unitless.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:37.420
Well, that is actually true.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.570
Let me think through this.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:42.410
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:43.900
PROFESSOR: About one bar,
one bar, one bar.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:44.630
That is actually true.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:49.270
They're both, that is true.

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:53.750
They are both unitless.

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.460
Well, this is a big boob
on my part here.

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.960
Because you are absolutely
right.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.280
Because there's one bar sitting
here. one bar, one

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.720
bar, one bar, one bar, and
the bars cancel out.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.850
Good catch.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.250
OK, the notes are right.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:13.060
My notes are right.

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.500
Alright.

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.440
Next time we'll talk about the
temperature dependence and the

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.260
pressure dependence of
equilibrium constants.
