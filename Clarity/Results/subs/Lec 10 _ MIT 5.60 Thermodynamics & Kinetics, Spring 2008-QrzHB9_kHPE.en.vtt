00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.900
PROFESSOR NELSON: Over the last
couple lectures through

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.400
our consideration of a number of
somewhat difficult topics,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.930
including these Carnot cycles
and specific Carnot engine to

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.970
represent them, we've tried to
define and understand a little

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.250
bit about this very special
function, this entropy.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.860
Where we've got our dS.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:56.960
It's dq reversible over T. And
our treatment of reversible

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.320
and irreversible cyclic
processes, what we saw is that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:16.460
if we go around a cycle and look
at dq reversible over T,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.250
then this is zero.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.830
Now go all the way around a
cycle, of course, this is just

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.160
delta S for the cycle.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.890
And that's consistent
with the idea that

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.070
entropy is a state functions.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.430
So if we go around cycle the
cycle, we have the same ending

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.936
point, the starting point, same
state, then the change in

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:39.420
the state function
has to be zero.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:48.140
But we saw that for an
irreversible path around a

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.540
cycle, then we have
that, this gives

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.920
something less than zero.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.610
And so that was expressed in
Clausius inequality that

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.140
includes both these cases.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.830
And now I just want to go
through a number of

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.440
calculations of entropy.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.480
How entropy changes for a number
processes, both to just

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.830
learn more about it in general
terms and also just to see how

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.060
it's calculated and what sort
of changes in undergoes for

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.770
different sorts of
changes in state.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.560
So the first very general
example that I want to show is

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.270
the following.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:46.180
Let's say we've got an isolated
system, and it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:57.780
undergoes some irreversible
change.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:09.050
So we'll start at one, and we'll
go irreversibly to some

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:19.070
new state, two.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:29.090
OK, now we can always return the
system back to the initial

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.760
state reversibly.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.040
If we do that, then we can't
keep the system isolated.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.760
So it won't be isolated
anymore.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.260
In other words, in order to
arrange things so that you

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.460
could have a return
along a reversible

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.130
path, it can't be isolated.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.190
In some sense you know that,
because when it was isolated

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.520
it spontaneously irreversibly
went from one to two.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.260
And example would be ice melting
at some temperature

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.500
that might be higher than
the freezing point.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.310
So you've got solid ice, but the
temperature is above zero

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.180
degrees Celsius, so irreversibly
it'll melt.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.710
Systems isolated, it'll melt.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.790
Then you could put the system
in contact with a cold

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.930
reservoir reversibly re-freeze
the water to form ice again.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.230
But of course to do that you
couldn't keep it isolated.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.270
You need to have it in contact
with a low temperature bath.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.190
But again, this is
just completely

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.100
general at this point.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.380
It's some irreversible process
returned then along a

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.520
reversible path.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.210
So let's just look
at what happens.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:51.360
So here's our path B.
Along path A, well

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.580
it's an isolated system.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.480
So the heat exchanged is zero.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:10.230
And then, for the cycle based
on the Clausius inequality

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:21.480
expressed here, the integral
around the cycle of dq over T

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.610
in general, it's less than
or equal to zero.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.890
If there was an irreversible
process involved, then in

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.810
fact, it'll be less than zero.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.940
I'll write it here in the more
general case, but we know what

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.110
it's really going to be with
the irreversible step.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.380
Well, so we can write this
as the integral of dq

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:58.920
irreversible over T, going from
state one to state two.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.720
Oh, let me rewrite
this down here.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:12.450
So around the cycle, dq over
T, it's integral from state

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:20.390
one to two of dq irreversible
over T, plus the integral from

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:28.120
two back to one of dq reversible
over T. And of

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.970
course, we know that that's less
than or equal to zero.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.740
But this, we know is zero,
right, because this

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.990
irreversible step is
taken in isolation.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.070
The system is isolated.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.550
We've already seen that there's
no heat crossing the

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.420
boundary of the system.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.110
So we just have this.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:57.060
So of course this dq reversible
over T from two to

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.930
one, that's, what now we've a
reversible path, so that's

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.830
just the entropy at the delta
S going from two to one.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:11.660
It's S1 minus S2 it's delta S,
we can write it as delta S

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.450
backwards, right, we're
going back along

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.460
that reversible path.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:23.580
Which is of course negative
delta S forward.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:29.880
Because around the whole cycle
delta s has to be zero.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:43.580
So what that says is delta S
forward is greater than or

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:50.120
equal to zero.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.260
That's interesting.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.160
What that's saying is --
remember, we didn't specify

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.760
the process.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.600
It's just for any completely
general irreversible process.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:06.320
For any such process, for any
spontaneous process, this is

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.070
going to be the case.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:14.360
So in other words, for an
isolated system, delta S tells

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.710
us the direction of spontaneous
change.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:29.180
In particular, for the isolated
system, delta S is

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:40.590
greater than zero for something
that's irreversible.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:51.330
Delta S equals zero for
something that's reversible,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:09:02.200
and delta S is never
less than zero.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.180
In a sense, this is a direct
consequence of the Clausius

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:11.720
inequality.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.200
That's a pretty useful result.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.450
So remember when we started this
whole discussion, I tried

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.200
to emphasize that the first law
of thermodynamics told us

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.020
about conservation of energy.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.280
But it didn't tell us which
way something would go

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.620
spontaneously if you just left
the system to its own devices

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.430
under certain conditions.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.440
This is telling us that.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.450
We can tell which way the system
will evolve in which

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.680
direction it'll go.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.530
This is for an isolated system
and we'll generalize this in

00:09:50.530 --> 00:10:00.570
subsequent lectures.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:06.090
Now, let's look at what
happens if the

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.920
system isn't isolated.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:25.710
So now let's go from one
to two not isolated.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:31.550
So of course, delta S I'm
going to specify for the

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:36.420
system for reasons that'll soon
be obvious is S2 for the

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.610
system minus S1 for
the system.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.360
Of course it doesn't depend on
the path, even though to

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:52.610
calculate it, we need to
find a reversible path.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.610
Just to add emphasis to what we
just did here, of course,

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.590
it was the same thing.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.440
In order to calculate delta S
along that irreversible path

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.380
for that irreversible process
we needed to construct some

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.270
reversible path.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.670
And what we did is imagined
the reversible path going

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.310
backwards and then said, OK,
fine then delta S for the

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.180
irreversible process must be the
opposite of delta S that

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.120
we calculated along the

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.850
reversible bath going backwards.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.820
The point is that to calculate
delta S in either direction,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.690
we needed to construct
some reversible path.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.650
All right, and of course
it'll be the same here.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.960
Now, in this case since the
system isn't isolated, that

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.830
means heat's going to flow
across the boundary.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.580
So that means heat is going
between, it's being exchanged

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.110
between the system and
the surroundings.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.150
So what's happening to
the surroundings?

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.430
Generally, we've worry a lot
about the system, but not much

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.560
in recent discussions about
the surroundings.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.520
But delta S surroundings
must be something.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.360
We could calculate it.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.500
And that's depends
on the path.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.450
Not because it isn't the state
function in the surroundings,

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:15.300
of course it is, but because
depending on the path, the

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.650
final state of the

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:22.060
surroundings will be different.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.550
After all, depending on how much
heat got exchanged, the

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.970
surroundings got more or
less of that heat.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.780
Work might have been done
on the surroundings.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.000
So the surroundings are going
to respond, are going to

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.040
change also, when the system
changes in this way and it's

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.990
not isolated.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.640
And how the surroundings change
will depend on what

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.820
path was taken.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.950
And you've seen that before
in calculating things like

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.450
pressure, volume, work along
different paths.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.580
Where you calculated delta u for
the system and saw that it

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.230
was the same for different paths
but q and w were not the

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.330
same for the system, and
therefore, of course, not for

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:07.710
the surroundings either.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:21.450
So let's just consider
an irreversible path.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.300
And in order to think about
what happens to the

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:29.890
surroundings, let's take the
entire universe which consists

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:36.550
of the system and the
surroundings -- that is a big

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.400
isolated system, because
it's everything.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.950
So it's not somehow in contact
with another additional body

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.000
or universe.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.720
We can treat the
entire universe

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.100
as an isolated system.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:05.690
So, we're going to think about
the entire universe.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:13.890
We can think about it as
an isolated system.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.050
Great.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:23.400
And we know that delta S for
an isolated system, for a

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.230
spontaneous process, is
greater than zero.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.130
That's right there.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:38.050
So delta S for the universe
which is delta S for the

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:44.950
system plus delta S for the
surroundings, and I'll specify

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.130
since we're considering an
irreversible process, specify

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.150
that, it's greater than zero.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.390
The whole thing happened
spontaneously, and the whole

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.790
universe is an isolated
system.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:03.190
So if we wanted to, we can
write that delta S

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.320
irreversible for the
surroundings must be bigger

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:15.340
than minus delta S for the
system in order that there sum

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.590
be positive.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.640
All right?

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:33.150
Now, if we consider a reversible
process, then of

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.160
course we already know what
happens for an isolated system

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:43.450
in a reversible process,
delta S is zero.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:47.820
So delta S in this case of the
whole universe, which is delta

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:53.860
S for the system plus delta S
for the surroundings in the

00:15:53.860 --> 00:16:02.210
reversible case must
be equal to zero.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:08.050
In other words, delta S of the
surroundings in the reversible

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:15.350
case is exactly the opposite
of delta S of the system.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.230
Delta S of the system is the
same in either case because

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.380
reversible or irreversible,
we're specifying the system,

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.940
goes between the same states,
but what happens to the

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:30.790
surroundings is different
in the two cases.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:36.590
So one way of recasting this
statement or the Clausius

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.080
inequality is the entropy
of the whole

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.720
universe never decreases.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.370
Of course, in some sense,
that's obvious from this

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.800
statement, since we're
considering the universe an

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.670
isolated system.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.900
So the entropy in any process
can, it can, the change in

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:04.950
entropy can either be zero or
positive and never negative.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:27.700
So entropy off the whole
universe never decreases.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.610
That's actually a really quite
profound conclusion.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:36.580
All sorts of philosophical and
other consequences of it that

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.670
are sometimes considered in
things like evolutionary

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.090
biology and other things.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.135
And how things can change
altogether an

00:17:43.135 --> 00:17:48.710
entire system of things.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:55.140
Now, I'd like to just go through
a few calculations of

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.140
delta S for common processes.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.970
We've seen a few general
features of entropy.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.980
Let's calculate it
for a few things.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:15.640
So calculations of
delta S. And we

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.700
know the general procedure.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.240
Whatever the process is, we're
going to need to find

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.830
reversible paths, and along a
reversible path then, we'll be

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.480
able to calculate it.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:39.230
One, let's just take two
pieces of material at

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.590
different temperatures.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:56.350
The entire system is going
to be isolated.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:01.010
And then let's connect them.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.830
And then let's connect them.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.480
Put some material
between them.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.500
So now heat can flow from
one to the other.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.410
And you know what's going to
happen which is if they start

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.340
out at unequal temperatures, and
you wait a little while,

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.020
eventually they're going
to wind up at the same

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.810
temperature.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.850
In other words, you
know the direction

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.950
of spontaneous change.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:23.950
So let's just see what
happens to delta S.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:33.550
So isolated system, so there's
no work being done.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.250
There's no heat that's
being exchanged.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:42.060
So delta u is zero.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.810
What's dS?

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:49.360
Well it's just the sum of the
changes in entropy for the two

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.450
sub-systems the two
separate pieces.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:20:03.880
So it's dq1 over T1 plus dq2
over T2, I think there's a

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:11.720
type in your notes. it's plus
not minus of course.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:16.410
But in this case, dq1 is just
the opposite of dq2.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:20.280
Because whatever heat is flowing
into T1, into this

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.770
block, is coming out of this
block, or vice versa,

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:32.490
depending on which
one is hotter.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:39.070
So this is just equal to dq1
times one over T1 minus one

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:45.700
over T2, which is T2 minus
T1 over T1 times T2.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.910
So that's dS, and then we could
integrate it to get the

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.380
delta S, but this is sufficient
for what I'd like

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.850
to illustrate, which is just
the sign of things.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:09.140
We know dS must be greater than
zero for the spontaneous

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.920
change that's going to occur.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.860
So let's just make sure that
common sense prevails here.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.810
That says if T2 is greater than
T1, right T2 is hotter.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:27.110
Then dq must be positive, so
this is positive, this is

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:30.240
positive, dS we know
has to be positive.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.440
So, it says T2 is hotter.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.790
This being positive means heat
is flowing in from this one to

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:45.230
this one, from the hotter
to the colder body.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.210
So it looks right.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.780
If T2 is lower than T1, if this
one is colder, then in

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.120
order for dS to be positive,
which it has to be, this

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.210
better be negative.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.160
In other words, again heat is
going to flow from the hotter

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.810
toward the colder, into
the colder body.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:11.890
So, as promised, the condition
that dS must be greater than

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:17.160
zero, guides us and tells us the
direction that spontaneous

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.050
change is going to occur.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.170
We can tell just from this
condition which way things

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:44.530
have to evolve.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.120
All right, let's try another
pretty simple process.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:59.690
Let's just take a gas in some
volume V and over here is

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:05.400
going to be vacuum of equal
volume, and we're going to

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.630
remove the barrier.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.260
You know what's going to happen
spontaneously, right?

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.490
The gas is going to fill the
available volume once it

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.540
becomes available.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:23.870
So this, we'll make this a Joule
expansion, and we'll

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:29.230
make it an ideal gas.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:37.590
So the process is one mole of
gas at our initial volume and

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:46.200
some temperature, and we'll make
this adiabatic, and this

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:53.360
goes to one mole of gas at a new
volume, 2V and at the same

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.750
temperature.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:24:01.350
All right, so there's
no work done.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:02.220
It's adiabatic.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.440
There's no heat exchanged.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.330
Delta u is zero.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.870
Everything's zero.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.700
Almost everything is zero.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.360
What isn't zero?

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:16.680
STUDENT: Entropy.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.300
PROFESSOR NELSON: Entropy.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.860
It's going to tell us which
way this whole thing goes.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.730
So this is an irreversible
process.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.020
In order to calculate delta
S we need to construct a

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.790
reversible path along
which this can go.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.830
So here's a way to do it.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.480
We could compress it back,
isothermally and reversibly.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.190
Just like the example I gave,
the general example, where I

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.750
mentioned the ice melting.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.140
In that case, it won't
be adiabatic.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.240
We'd have to put it in
contact with a heat

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.840
source of some sort.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:25:00.420
So reversible process.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:21.870
We could compress it back to
volume V, isothermally, and

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:22.880
reversibly.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.860
Let me say, there's no -- we
wouldn't have to consider this

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:26.880
process in reverse.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.400
Of course, we could also
consider the forward process

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:34.480
in the presence of some heat
source with isn't isolated and

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.670
do this, but let's just consider
the compression.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:46.450
So, OK, now we'll have
the -- well, once

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.930
again, delta u is zero.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.090
It's an ideal gas.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.530
There's no temperature change.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.150
But this time q and w aren't
going to be zero.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.270
They're going to be some
finite numbers that are

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.310
opposites of each other.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:05.750
Because we're no longer
isolated.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:19.360
So let's just write out delta
S to go backward is dq

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:28.210
reversible over T, and
that's minus dw

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:32.550
over T, not zero anymore.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:39.420
And where we're going is from
2V to V, we're compressing,

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.670
and it's an ideal gas.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:59.620
So this is the same as p dV, but
it's p dV over T which is

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.960
the same thing as going from
2V to V. Now we're going to

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.110
replace this with RT over V,
and the T's will cancel.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:16.770
So it's R dV over V going from
2V to one V. So it's just R

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:23.440
times the log of 1/2.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.190
So now we've just calculated
the value of delta S by

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.080
constructing this
reversible path.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.260
Now this is delta S backward.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:38.070
To do the compression, so of
course delta S forward is just

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:46.930
the opposite of that.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:58.460
So, delta S forward
is R log 2.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:12.920
Reassuringly, that's
a positive number.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.830
So this process that we
considered originally, this

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.370
irreversibly process in this
isolated system, remember, for

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.720
the irreversible expansion
we considered the system

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.880
isolated, Happened
spontaneously, and of course

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.430
you know that's the case.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:37.570
Now, I'll just mention, and
later on we'll go into this in

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.310
considerably more detail, but
I'll just mention at this

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:45.130
stage through a little bit of
sort of foreshadowing that

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:49.040
everything we've discussed so
far about entropy is with a

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.720
macroscopic picture.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.010
We started with heat engines
and Carnot cycles and

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.690
macroscopic processes,
reversible and irreversible

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.790
processes and so on.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:02.620
But there's a, and that's
certainly the way it was all

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.080
formulated originally.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.960
Part of the power of
thermodynamics is that it

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.190
doesn't depend on a specific
microscopic model of matter.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.220
That said though, we
have a pretty good

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.670
microscopic model of matter.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.170
We know about atoms and
molecules, and in fact there

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:25.890
is an entirely microscopic
formulation of entropy that

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:31.310
has to do with disorder and
the number of available

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:36.920
states, microscopic states
available to a system.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:42.050
So I'll just state what
we'll see in much more

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.010
detail later on.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:56.940
Which is in microscopic terms,
it's going to turn out that

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:04.270
the entropy of a system can be
given by R over Avogadro's

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:21.160
number times the log of the
number of distinct microscopic

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.840
states that are available
to a system.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.030
Right so in this isolated
system, when we double that

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:34.240
volume, each molecule suddenly
has twice as many states

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.430
available to it.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.140
You could formulate that
in a lot of ways.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.350
You can sort of divide up the
volume into tiny little

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:46.240
molecule-sized cubes and realize
well, now, there are

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.730
twice as many of them.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.950
Now if I have one molecule, the
number of states doubles.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.080
If I have n molecules, the
number of states goes

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.540
up by 2 to the n.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.690
Because for each one of the
molecules, I can select any

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.150
one of those states, and
then the next one I

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.110
can select any one.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.570
So you have this enormous
increase in

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:08.370
the number of states.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:19.740
So delta S in this case looks
like R over NA log of 2 to the

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.110
power NA, it's Avogadro's
number,

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.300
for a mole of molecules.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:30.690
This can come out
and cancel this.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:34.560
There's our R log 2 result.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.210
But the point I'm making here
is that could actually be

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:42.800
derived from entirely
microscopic consideration.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.580
We haven't gone through
that yet.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.040
We've done entirely macroscopic
thermodynamics so

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.480
far, but we'll do a little bit
of treatment of statistical

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:56.000
mechanics, is what is called
the whole microscopic

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.620
formulation of entropy
in thermodynamics.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:03.680
And that's a really important
fundamental result.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.540
And we'll get to it in much
more detail in a while.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.580
But for now, I just want to
continue calculating entropy

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:31.680
changes for a few more
kinds of processes.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:37.940
So, how about if we have two
different substances and we

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:50.280
mix them, entropy of mixing.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:33:00.530
So, we start with some number
of moles of substance A in

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:05.480
some volume VA, and some other
number of moles of substance B

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.420
in volume VB, separated.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.800
And then we remove the barrier,
of course we know

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.580
they're going to mix.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:19.940
So we'll have some total number
of moles, nA plus nB,

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.650
and they'll be filling some
total volume, which is the sum

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.940
of the two original volumes.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.750
Certainly this is what
we expect to happen

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.760
spontaneously.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:41.370
So are process is nA moles of A,
gas, initial volume VA and

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:48.380
T, plus nB of substance B, I
think this is miswritten as A

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.980
there in your notes.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:34:01.780
Gas VB and T goes to nA moles of
A plus nB moles of B. Gas,

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:11.490
total volume and T. And
we'll have constant

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:15.310
temperature and pressure.

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:19.350
Well, there was no
p v worked done.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.370
The temperature didn't change
and it's ideal gases, so delta

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:28.340
u is zero, but what
about delta S?

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.880
Well again, to calculate
it, we need to find

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.890
a reversible path.

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.200
This is irreversible if we just
remove the barrier and

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.080
let it all go.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.620
But we could at least imagine
a reversible path, and we

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.730
could actually construct this
for the right substances.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:53.560
We could imagine that we can
find some sort of piston here.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:35:00.920
And we're going to prepare
to push it inward, with a

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:07.880
membrane that's permeable
only to b.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:14.410
And over here we could set up
the exact same thing, but this

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:23.580
one's permeable only to a.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.840
And then we could just push them
to recover this state.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.470
And we can do it reversibly.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:33.480
So we could construct a
reversible process that does

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.900
the reverse of this.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.810
And in this case, it'll be
isothermal still, constant

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:45.950
pressure, reversible compression
of the two gases.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:36:22.580
So, reversible compression
and demixing.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.980
All right, so what happens?

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:28.800
Well, of course, our delta S
of demixing is going to be

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.900
minus delta S of mixing.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:40.800
Delta u of demixing
is still zero.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:47.370
Temperature didn't change, ideal
gases, and there's some

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:52.000
reversible work and heat.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:04.730
So dw in this reversible case,
is just minus pA dVA minus pB

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:12.940
dVB, the infinitesimal amount
of work done as these things

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.380
are gradually moved
toward each other.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:27.000
So delta S for demixing, of
course it's dq reversible over

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.960
T, but just like we did right
there, of course, in this case

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.070
that's just negative dw.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:40.390
So it's integral from V to VA,
right, were compressing.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:43.320
So for substance a, we're going
to go back to there.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.620
It was occupying the whole
volume, and then it's going to

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.340
end up in only part
of the volume, VA.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:38:06.840
pA dVA over T. Same thing for
B, going to volume B, pB dVB

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.980
over T. And now we can
substitute for pressure,

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:22.360
right? pV is nRT, so it's nA
times R log of VA over V plus

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:33.580
nB of R log of VB over V.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.720
Now, so this is a suitable
answer, but I'm going to make

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:42.020
if a little easier by putting
in terms of mole fractions.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:39:05.700
So, mole fractions, of course,
XA is nA over n, and XB is nB

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:13.750
over n and XA is also equal to
VA over V and XB is equal to

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:17.140
VB over V for ideal
gases, right?

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.940
The molar volumes
are the same.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.600
We're at the same temperature
and pressure.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:32.140
So that immediately gives us the
delta X of demixing is nR

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:42.660
times XA log XA plus
XB log XB.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:47.030
And of course delta S of mixing
is the opposite of

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:58.930
this, minus nR XA log
XA plus XB log XB.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.520
Now XA and XB are
mole fractions.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:05.880
They are between zero and
one, So their log

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.590
rhythms are both negative.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.160
There's a negative sign.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.660
So delta S of mixing
is positive.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.070
That's reassuring.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.530
That tells us as we expect that
the mixing should happen

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:28.130
spontaneously and irreversibly
when we remove the barrier.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:31.130
Any questions so far about how
we're going about these

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:34.640
calculations of delta S?

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:52.740
OK, let's just do a couple
more examples.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.900
Here's a really straightforward
one.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.270
What if we just heat stuff
up or cool it down.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:02.430
It happens all the time, but
it's pretty important, right?

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:12.320
So let's just heat or cool
at constant volume.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:17.120
So, we're going to go from
substance A at T1 and some

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:22.280
volume going to substance
A at T2 at some volume.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.940
We can do this.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:35.520
Delta S is integral of dq
reversible over T. Going from

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:43.400
T1 to T2, but we know how
to do this, right?

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.890
It's the heat that we need.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.710
It's just given by the constant
volume heat capacity

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:49.320
times the change
in temperature.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:42:04.230
So this is just T1 to T2, Cv dT
over T. And that is just Cv

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:16.990
times the log of T2 over T1 if
Cv is temperature independent.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.720
That's not always the case.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.770
Usually if it's not too big an
excursion of temperature then

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:25.950
it's a reasonable
approximation.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:33.080
So that's straightforward.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:43.560
By the way, notice that delta
S is greater than zero if T2

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.780
is greater than T1.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:45.080
1

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:50.060
In other words, if we heated
it up, delta S is positive.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:55.040
Notice also delta S is
less than zero if T2

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.880
is less than T1.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.860
Delta S is negative
if we cooled it.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:06.520
Now, under certain conditions
we've seen that delta S can't

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.950
be negative.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.930
Why can it be negative here?

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:14.530
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.250
PROFESSOR NELSON:
Yes, I heard it.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.810
It's because the system
isn't isolated, right.

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.290
It was for the isolated system
that delta S is always greater

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:24.590
than or equal to zero.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:27.020
And you know, for the whole
universe entropy never

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.210
decreases and so on.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:32.980
In this case, though, you know
we're taking a system and

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.510
we're putting it in contact
with a cold bath

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.380
and cooling it down.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.150
It's certainly not isolated.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.830
Heat is being exchanged.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:43.880
It's going from the system to
the surroundings, to the bath.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.570
So it's fine.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.080
Delta S can be negative.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:53.110
What would happen if we
calculated delta S of a new

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.860
entire system consisting
of the original system

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.810
plus the heat bath?

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.120
What would delta S be then?

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:07.790
We already kind of did that with
those two blocks, T1 and

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:11.030
T2 in an isolated systems.

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:13.570
What do you think is
going to happen?

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:17.690
In other words, if we call our
system the stuff that is put

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:21.010
in contact with the heat bath,
well OK, then we've seen delta

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:24.570
S can be plus, can be positive
or negative.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:28.200
Now let's call our system the
original system plus the heat

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.160
bath, and we'll put them all in
some isolating box, that's

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.080
thermally isolating and so on.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.020
And now we'll put our original
system, which is now sort of a

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.590
sub, part of the system, and
it's now going to be in

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:45.450
contact with the cold bath.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:48.440
The bath that it's in contact
with is colder than it is.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.920
That's why its delta S
is less than zero.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.950
But what's delta S to be for
the entire new system

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:58.350
including the cold bath?

00:44:58.350 --> 00:44:59.740
STUDENT: Wouldn't it
greater than zero?

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.540
PROFESSOR NELSON: Yes, it's
going to be positive, because

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.000
it's an isolated system
and something happened

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.040
spontaneously in it, namely the
original system got cooler

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.250
and presumably the heat
bath got at least

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:12.900
a little bit warmer.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.370
And it happened spontaneously,
which immediately means delta

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:20.660
S had to be positive for that
entire assembly, of you know

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:25.160
the original system
plus the bath.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:32.580
Here's another important
sort of process.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:44.110
Reversible phase change, we'll
melt something or freeze it.

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:50.190
How about water -- liquid
100 degrees Celsius

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:54.270
one bar goes to water.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:46:01.500
Gas 100 degrees Celsius
one bar.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.510
Well in that case, you know
what the heat is.

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:11.750
It's just the delta H of
vaporization, right, at

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:15.060
constant pressure.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.550
So there's nothing really
much to calculate here.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:27.480
Delta S of vaporization for H2O
at 100 degrees Celsius is

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:36.080
just q of vaporization over the
boiling temperature, which

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:43.820
is delta H of vaporization over
the boiling temperature.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.800
So that was easy.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.320
One last thing.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:54.130
What if we want to calculate the
entropy of melting or some

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.870
phase transition not
at equilibrium?

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:59.920
In this case it's at equilibrium
because it's water

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.190
and water vapor at 100 degrees
Celsius and one

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:05.870
atmosphere or one bar.

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:08.710
So it's at its boiling point.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:14.690
But what if it isn't at
its boiling point?

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:24.570
So what if instead, let's take
H2O, liquid, at minus ten

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:29.580
degrees Celsius and one
bar so it's cold.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.300
It's going to freeze.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.620
So it's going to turn into
solid water at minus 10

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.540
degrees Celsius and one bar,
we're going to have it be

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.930
isothermal.

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:44.320
Now you know that's going to
happen spontaneously, and it's

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:52.730
irreversible.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:56.320
Irreversible, which means we
can't just straight away

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.520
calculate delta S along
this path because it's

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.760
irreversible.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.100
But what we can do, just like
we've done before for making

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.610
cycles, we can make some other
set of events that are all

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.240
reversible.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.410
We can construct a reversible
pass that will get there.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:13.560
How do we do it?

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:17.020
Well you know for the phase
change, for the freezing to be

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.890
reversible, it has to happen at
zero degrees Celsius right.

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.030
You know that's where
you have reversible,

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.230
freezing and melting.

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:28.750
Reversible equilibrium between
liquid and solid water.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:33.160
So surely that's got to
get involved here.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:39.520
H2O liquid zero degrees
Celsius, one bar, in

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.550
equilibrium with H2O solid at
zero degrees Celsius, one bar.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:48.590
Whatever reversible path we
construct that's going to go

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:52.640
from liquid to solid water,
somewhere along the set of

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.570
steps, that better
be one of them.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.500
So now what we need to do is
go from liquid at minus 10

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:02.850
degrees Celsius and one bar to
liquid at zero degrees Celsius

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:05.520
and one bar.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.140
That's called heating.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.770
We have to heat it.

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:15.240
And here we have to cool it.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.170
And we've already seen all these
three processes, right.

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:23.890
So for the phase change,
it's reversible now.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:26.790
This is just delta
heat of fusion.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:30.130
Great.

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:33.490
Because this is now
reversible.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.010
This is going to
be reversible.

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:37.400
This is going to be reversible.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.320
Great.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:43.630
So dq reversible, it's going
to be the heat capacity at

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:46.350
constant pressure, the example
we did before it was constant

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:51.380
volume for the liquid dT.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:59.650
Here, dq reversible is going
to be Cp solid, dT.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:01.180
Those won't be the same right?

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:03.600
It's one thing to say the heat
capacity of something doesn't

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.170
change over some small excursion
in temperature, but

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.520
it's another thing when the
thing actually changes phase.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.350
The heat capacity of the
solid and the liquid

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:14.690
won't be the same.

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:18.020
So this we can just finish up in
a jiffy, because we're just

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:23.310
going to add the three things.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:30.720
So delta S is delta S of
heating, minus, I think

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.960
there's a plus that should be
a minus there, minus delta S

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.150
of fusion because it's going in
the direction of freezing

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:38.070
the way we've written it.

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:42.730
Plus delta S of cooling.

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:52.770
So integral from T1 to the
melting point of Cp of the

00:50:52.770 --> 00:51:01.930
liquid dT over T, minus delta
H of fusion over the melting

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:03.720
temperature.

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.750
Plus the integral going from the
heat of the temperature of

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:15.100
melting to T1 of Cp of
the solid dT over T.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.770
That's it, all right?

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:24.870
So delta S is minus delta H of
fusion over T. That's what it

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:27.300
would be for just the reversible
phase change

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:30.190
happening at zero
degrees Celsius.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:34.227
And then there's this additional
part which is, we

00:51:34.227 --> 00:51:39.370
can write it from T1 to melting
point of Cp of the

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:47.140
liquid, minus Cp of the
solid, dT over T.

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:50.320
Now usually we can assume that
these will be temperature

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:55.080
independent in their
own phases.

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:59.950
So we can usually write this
as minus delta H of fusion

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:10.080
over the melting temperature
plus Cp of the liquid minus Cp

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:21.970
of the solid log of T
of fusion over T1.

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:24.580
Any questions?

00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:25.900
What did we do?

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.785
We constructed a reversible path
going from here to here

00:52:28.785 --> 00:52:31.380
and calculated delta S that way,
and of course that has to

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:36.110
be the same as delta S in the
one irreversible step.

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:40.360
All right, more on entropy and
its consequences for how to

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.930
figure out what happened
spontaneously next time.
