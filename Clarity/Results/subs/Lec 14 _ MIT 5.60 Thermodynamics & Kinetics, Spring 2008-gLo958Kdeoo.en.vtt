00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.540
PROFESSOR: Last time,
you talked about

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.270
the Gibbs free energy.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.570
And the fundamental equations.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.820
And how powerful the fundamental
equations were in

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.410
being able to calculate anything
from pressure,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.310
volume, temperature data.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.350
And you saw that the Gibbs free
energy was especially

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.730
important for everyday
sort of processes.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.250
Because of the constant
pressure constraint.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.590
And the fact that the intrinsic
variables are

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.910
pressure and temperature.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.060
Well, it turns out that the
Gibbs free energy is even more

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.850
important than that.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.580
And this is something that it
took me a while to learn.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.690
I had to take thermodynamics
many times to really

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.770
appreciate how important
that was.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.480
Even when I was doing research,
at the beginning, I

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.770
was a theorist, and I was trying
to calculate different

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.440
quantities of liquids and
polymers and in these papers

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.225
the first thing they did was
to calculate the Gibbs free

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:29.530
energy and I didn't quite
appreciate why

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.050
they were doing that.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.640
And the reason is, is if you've
got the Gibbs free

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.320
energy, you got really
everything you need to know.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.000
Because you can get everything
from the Gibbs free energy.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.880
And it really becomes the
fundamental quantity that you

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.890
want to have.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.620
So let me give you an example
of how important that is, if

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.660
you have an equation that
describes the Gibbs free

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.780
energy as a function of pressure
and temperature,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.450
number of moles of
different things.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.570
Different things you
can calculate.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.290
So let's just start from the
fundamental equation for the

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:12.970
Gibbs free energy, dG is
minus S dT plus V dp.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.330
And let's say that you've gotten
some expression, G, as

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.670
a function of temperature and
pressure for your system.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.700
It could be, as we're going to
see today that we're going to

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.580
increase the number of variables
here, by making the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.670
system more complicated.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.100
So what I'm saying, now what I'm
going to say now, is going

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.010
to be more general than just
these two variables here.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.110
So you've gotten this.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.280
So you have this.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.070
You've got the fundamental
equation.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.920
You've got all the other
fundamental equations, and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.700
from there you can calculate
all these quantities.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.270
For instance, you can calculate
an expression for S.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.320
Because you know that S, from
the fundamental equation, is

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.920
just the derivative of G, with
respect to T, keeping the

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.330
pressure fixed.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.440
So you've got your equation for
G. That translates into an

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.360
equation for S. You can get
volume, volume is not one of

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.330
the variables.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.340
Temperature and pressure
are the two knobs.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.030
But you can get volume out,
because volume is the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.540
derivative of G, with
respect to pressure.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.420
Keeping the temperature
constant.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.090
And you've got S now,
you got volume.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.410
Do you know where you,
how did you define G

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.380
in the first place?

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.030
We define G as H minus dS.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.020
One of the many definitions
of g.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.530
Reverse that, you've got now
H as a function of G and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.350
temperature and entropy.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.820
Well, you've got an expression
for G, we just calculated, we

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.110
just showed we could get an
expression for S, which is

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.410
sitting right here.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.170
Temperature is a variable
here, so now we have an

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.490
expression for H. And you can
go on like that with every

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.230
variable that you've learned
in this class already.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.260
For instance, u is H minus pV.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.200
Well, there's the H here.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.060
We have that equation for H.
We have an equation for V,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.730
coming from here.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.860
So there's nothing
unknown here.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.600
If we have an equation for G
here in terms of temperature

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.740
and pressure.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.740
Same thing for the Helmholtz
free energy.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.830
You can even get the heat
capacities out.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.010
Every single one of these
interesting, useful quantities

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.590
that one would want to calculate
falls out from the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.380
Gibbs free energy here.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.730
Any questions on that
important step?

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.240
And, really, I can't believe
how clueless I was when I

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.650
started doing research.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.970
Because I would go through the
process of calculating G, and

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.340
getting G, and et cetera,
et cetera.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.270
I wrote papers, you know,
G equals blah blah blah.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.040
And I didn't realize that that's
why people wanted to

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.780
know G. Anyway, I
know better now.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.750
So, there are a few things we
can say about G that are

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.430
fairly easy to calculate.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.980
For instance, if I look
at liquids or solids.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.890
And I want to know how G
changes with pressure.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:49.860
So, I know that the volume here
dG/dp, that dG/dp is the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.400
volume here.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.220
So if I look under constant
temperature, I pick my

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.830
fundamental equation under
constant temperature, and I

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.270
want to know how G is changing,
I integrate.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.570
So I have dG is equal to V dp.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.620
So if I change my, and I look
at per mole, and if I change

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.680
my pressure from p1 to p2, I
integrate from p1 to p2, p1 to

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:23.600
p2 here, final state minus the
initial state is equal to the

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:31.920
integral from p1 to
p2, V dp per mole.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.000
And what can I say, for a liquid
or a solid, the volume

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.960
per mole, over a liquid or a
solid, is small and it doesn't

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.560
change very much.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.410
So V is small.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.320
And usually these solids and
liquids, you can assume to be

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.860
incompressible.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.765
Meaning, as you change
the pressure, the

00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:57.700
volume doesn't change.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.670
It's a good approximation.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.310
So when you do your integral
here, you get that G at the

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.080
new pressure is G at the old
pressure, then if this isn't

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.190
changing very much with
pressure, or not at all, then

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.850
you can take it out.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.430
It's just a constant.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.900
Plus V times p2 minus p1.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.940
And so, this is the
incompressible

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.800
part, you take it out.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.190
The fact that it's small means
that you can assume that this

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.620
is zero, this whole thing is
zero, that it's small enough.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.630
And then you see that G,
approximately doesn't change

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.830
with pressure.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:43.820
Tells you that G, for a liquid
or solid, most of the time you

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.230
can assume that it's just a
function of temperature.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.310
Just like we saw for an ideal
gas, that the energy and the

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.280
enthalpy were just functions
of temperature.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.430
And that's a useful
approximation.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.640
It's useful, but it's
not completely true.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.330
And if it were true, then
there would not be any

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.170
pressure dependents to
phase transitions.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.620
And we know that's
not the case.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:11.730
We know that if you press on
water when it's close to the

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:21.200
water liquid-solid transition,
that you can lower the melting

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.590
point of ice.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.120
You press on ice, and you press
hard enough, and ice

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.030
will melt, the temperature is
closer to melting point.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.110
And we'll go through that.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.450
So, that means that there has
to be some sort of pressure

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.890
dependence, eventually.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.380
And we'll see that.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.210
This is just an approximation.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:39.940
What else can we do?

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.750
We can calculate, also,
for an ideal gas.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:50.910
Liquid and solid, we can
do an ideal gas.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.990
So for an ideal gas, again,
starting from the fundamental

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:59.990
equation, we have
dG equals V dp.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:04.780
We can do it per mole.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:10.530
So integrate both sides, G(T,
p2) is equal to G at the

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.630
initial pressure, plus
the integral from

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.890
p1 to p2, the volume.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.080
So instead of putting the
volume, this is an ideal gas

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.220
now, we can put the
ideal gas law.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.870
So V is really RT over p.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.890
RT over p dp.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.730
We can integrate this.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.180
Get a log term out.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:42.080
G(T, p1) plus RT
log p2 over p1.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.410
And then it's very useful to
reference everything to the

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:51.040
center state. p1 is equal
to one bar, let's say.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:58.680
So if you take p1 equals one
bar as our reference point,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.460
and get rid of the little
subscript two here, we can

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.170
write G of T at some pressure
p, then is G and the little

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:14.610
naught on top here means
standard state one bar plus RT

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:20.730
log p divided by one bar.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:26.350
And I put in a little dotted
line here because very often

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.550
you just write it without
the one bar and bar.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.640
And you know that there has to
be a one bar, because inside a

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.500
log you can't have something
with units.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.360
It has to be unitless.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.420
So you know if you have
something with bar here,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.100
you've got to divide with
something with bar, and there

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.940
happens to be one bar here.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.850
So pressure p is G at its
standard state plus RT log p.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.680
And this becomes a
very useful, very

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:56.060
useful, quantity to know.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.190
OK, so G is so important.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:06.430
And G per mole is so
fundamental, that we're going

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.470
to give it a special name.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.610
Not to make your life more
complicated but just because

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.410
it's just so important.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.040
We're going to call it the
chemical potential.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.100
So G per mole, we're
going to call mu.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.580
And that's going to be
a chemical potential.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.750
We're going to do a
lot more with the

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:30.390
chemical potential today.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.590
And the reason why we call
potential is because we

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:40.240
already saw that if you've got
something under constant

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:48.640
pressure, temperature, that
you want to use G as the

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.290
variable to tell you whether
something is going to be

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.950
spontaneous or not.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.190
So you want G to go downhill.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.940
And so, we're going
to be talking

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.520
about chemical species.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.410
And instead of having a car up
and down mountains, trying to

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.060
go down to the valleys, we're
going to have chemical species

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.330
trying to find the valleys.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.850
The potential valleys.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.890
To get to equilibrium.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.870
And so we're going to be looking
at the Gibbs free

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.030
energy, or the Gibbs free
energy per mole at that

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.220
particular species, and it's
going to want to be as small

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.580
as possible.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.410
We're going to want to
minimize the chemical

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.600
potentials.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.370
And that's why it's
called potential.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:34.800
It's like an energy.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:45.900
So, that's the end of the one
component, thermodynamic

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.170
background, before we get
to multi-components.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.950
So it's a good time to
stop again and see

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.950
if there's any questions.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:13:01.850
Any issues.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.610
OK.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.120
So, so far we've done everything
with one species.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.180
One ideal gas, one liquid,
one solid.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.380
We haven't done anything with
mixtures, except for maybe

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.210
looking at the entropy
of mixing.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.990
We saw the entropy of mixing was
really important, because

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:24.470
it drove processes where
energy was constant.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.410
But most of what we care about
in chemistry, at least in

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.790
chemical reactions,
species change.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.660
They get destroyed.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.120
New species get created.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.120
There are mixtures.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.440
It's pretty complicated.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.350
For instance, if I take a
reaction of hydrogen gas plus

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:49.630
chlorine gas to form two moles
of HCl gas, I'm destroying

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.200
hydrogen, I'm destroying
chlorine, I'm making HCl in

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.330
the gas phase.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.630
I get a big mixture
at the end.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.040
I get three different kinds
of species at the end.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.550
So the fundamental equations
that I've been talking about,

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.350
that we've been talking
about, they're too

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.400
simple for such a system.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.990
Because they all care
about one species.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.480
Even more complicated, for
instance, if I take hydrogen

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:22.310
gas and oxygen gas and I mix
them together to make water,

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.540
liquid, for instance, not only
do I have species that are

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.240
changing, that are getting
destroyed or created, in this

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.250
case here the total number
of moles is changing.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.690
And the phase is changing.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.450
Got all sorts of changes
going on here.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.390
And so if I want to understand
equilibrium, if I want to

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.790
understand the direction
of time for these more

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.330
complicated processes, I have
to be able to take into

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:55.590
account, in an easy way, these
mixing processes, these phase

00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:03.730
changes, these changes in
the number of moles.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:07.000
And that's what we're going
to talk about today.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.010
We're going to try to change our
fundamental equations to

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.140
make them a little bit more
complicated so that we can

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.500
deal with these sorts
of problems.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.070
Because those are the real
problems we need

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.950
to keep track of.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.540
And the ultimate goal, then,
of changing our fundamental

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.320
questions is to derive
equilibrium from first

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320
principles.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.190
To really understand chemical
equilibrium, which you've all

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:31.680
seen before.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.410
You've all used the chemical
equilibrium constant K, you've

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.770
done problems.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.400
But you've been given,
basically, the equilibrium

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.870
constant, and not really derived
it, understood where

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:48.790
it came from.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:53.800
OK, another simple example here,
which is actually the

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.820
one that we're going to be
looking at in the first case.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.520
Where there's a change
going on, is just to

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.360
look at a phase change.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.840
H2O liquid going to H2O solid.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.040
There's a phase change, you
can think of it as one

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.590
species, the H2O liquid
sort of changing

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.710
into an H2O a solid.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.340
It's the same chemical in this
case here, there's no change

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.890
in the molecules.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:27.640
But it's still a change that
we have to account for.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.910
Another example that's also
simple like this, that you

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:41.990
all, I'm sure, have seen before,
suppose I take a cell.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.780
My cell here, full of water.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:50.930
And then I put my cell, let's
say I take a human cell.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.000
My skin or something.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:03.350
And I take it and I put
it in distilled water.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:07.600
What's going to happen
to the cell?

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.520
Is it going to be happy?

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.580
What's going to happen to it?

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.330
It's going to burst, right?

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.470
Why is it going to burst?

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:26.060
Anybody have an idea why
it's going to burst?

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:26.460
Yes.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:38.260
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:38.780
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.960
So the water wants to go from,
you're completely right.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.330
But let me rephrase it in a
thermodynamic language here.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.770
The water is going to go from
a place of high chemical

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:52.720
potential to low chemical
potential.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.650
And the cell can't take all
that water in there.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.290
The membrane's going
to try to swell.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.700
And eventually burst, right?

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.680
Same thing if you if you take
a, go fishing, go to the

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.040
Atlantic Ocean and then get
a nice cod or something.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.950
Bring it back and on your
sailboat, you dump it in a tub

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.770
of fresh water.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.380
Is that cod going to be happy?

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.390
It's not going to be happy at
all, right, because its

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.910
biology is geared towards
living in salt water.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.170
And turns out that the chemical
potential of water,

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.860
in salt water, is lower
than the chemical

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.830
potential of pure water.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.590
And so when you put the cod in
there, the chemical potential

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.340
of the water and the cod, is
lower than the chemical

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.480
potential of the fresh water
you have on the outside.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.180
And the fresh water
wants to be at a

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:44.965
lower chemical potential.

00:18:44.965 --> 00:18:48.410
It rushes into the cod, and
well, the cod does what the

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.960
cell does, when you put
it in distilled water.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.980
It sort of bloats.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.920
It isn't very happy.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.150
OK, so but all these things
are basically

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.250
the same idea here.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.220
Where you have a complicated
change, where species are

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.320
mixing, and things like this.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.500
And it turns out the chemical
potential is going to tell us

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.430
all about how to think
about that.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.650
That's why the chemical
potential is so important.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.070
So we're going to go
back to these two

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:23.940
examples here many times.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.000
So let's take the simplest
example here.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.900
Let's go back and derive
some equations.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.280
Let's take our simplest example
that's not a one

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.000
species system, but
has two species.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.820
Species 1 and 2.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:50.450
And n1 and n2 are the number of
moles of species 1 and 2.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.490
And then we're going
to see if I make a

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.150
perturbation in my system.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.940
I change the number of
moles of 1, or the

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.850
number of moles of 2.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.030
How does this affect the
Gibbs free energy?

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.730
That's the question we're
going to post.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.880
And our goal is to find a new
fundamental equation for G

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.670
that includes the number of
moles of the different species

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:13.730
as they change.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.730
Because in chemistry they're
going to be changing.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.330
They're not going to be fixed.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:23.560
So what we want is just purely
mathematically formally, take

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.200
the differential of the Gibbs
free energy, which we know is

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:33.060
dG/dT, keeping pressure, the
number of moles of 1, the

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.910
number of 2 constant, dT.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:43.820
That is, dG/dp constant
temperature, n1 and n2 dp.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:48.920
And then we have our two more
variables now, dG/dn1,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.570
remember this is just a formal
statement keeping temperature

00:20:53.570 --> 00:21:03.000
and pressure and n2 constant.
dn1 plus dG/dn2, dn2 keeping

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.090
temperature and pressure
and n1 constant here.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.910
I'm not writing anything new
here, I'm just telling you

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.890
what the definition of the
differential is here, for G.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.950
We already know what some
of these quantities are.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:23.410
We know that this is the
entropy, minus the entropy.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:28.930
This here is the volume.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.440
And I know the answer already.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.180
But I'm going to define
it anyways.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.710
And we're going to prove it.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.610
I'm going to define this
as the chemical

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:46.210
potential for species 1.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:51.640
I'm going to define this, I'm
going to give it a symbol,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.960
chemical potential mu,
for species 2.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:02.490
So that I can write my new
fundamental equation as dG as

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.890
minus S dT.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:11.570
Plus V dp plus, and if I have
more than two species present,

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:17.060
the sum of all species in my
mixture times the chemical

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:21.380
potential of that
species, dni.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:27.510
The change in the number of
moles of that species.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:36.500
So, this quantity mu, that I've
just defined, dG/dni,

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.700
keeping the temperature, the
pressure and all the n's,

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.220
except for the i'th one
constant, that is

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.180
an intensive quantity.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:53.250
Because G scales with size,
scales, with size of system.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.470
G is intensive. n, obviously,
scales with

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.800
the size of the system.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.000
Also intensive, and you take
the ratio of two extensive

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.640
variables, you get an intensive
variable which

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.610
doesn't care about the
size of the system.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:09.890
Which is a good thing.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.730
For what we've been
talking about.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.670
Intensive.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.500
If I'm talking about putting a
freshwater fish and dumping it

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.870
in the, putting it in the
Atlantic Ocean, the chemical

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.750
potential of the water in the
Atlantic ocean better not care

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:29.440
whether the Atlantic Ocean
is huge or even huger.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.760
It just cares about the
local environment.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:39.150
Just cares that it that wants to
be in that freshwater fish.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.720
So the chemical potential
is intensive.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.690
Just as we've written
it down here for a

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.150
single species system.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.710
It's the Gibbs energy,
free energy per mole.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.330
Which we haven't proven yet.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.880
We haven't proven yet here.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.490
We've just defined it this way
and we're going to prove that

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.940
in fact the mu's are the Gibbs
free energies per mole for

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:07.820
each of the species
in our system.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:14.240
OK, so this is now our first
new fundamental equation.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.840
All we did was to add
the sum here.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.970
Now, we started the lecture by
saying that if you have the

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:24.170
Gibbs free energy, you've
got everything.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:30.220
And we wrote equations that are
covered, were we can get

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:35.160
S, we can get V, we can get H,
we can get u, we can get A. So

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.380
now that we have a fundamental
question for G, we've got our

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.470
new fundamental equations
for everything else.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:45.290
Without really thinking
too much.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:50.260
We go back to our definitions.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.840
Enthalpy is G minus TS.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:06.550
So dH is dG minus d of TS. dG,
we've got our new fundamental

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.450
equation for G. We
plug it in here.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.440
Expand things out with a T dS
here, we can write immediately

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:19.840
a fundamental equation
for H. dH is T dS.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.210
The beginning is going
to look just like

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.310
what you've seen before.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.540
Plus V dp.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:28.630
Plus an extra term, which is
exactly the same extra term

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.100
that we had in the fundamental
equation for

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.550
G. Exactly the same.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.090
And every one of the other
fundamental questions can be

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.600
derived in the similar way from
G. And they're going to

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:50.280
be what you had before minus S
dT plus minus p dV plus the

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:59.800
sum of the mu i's, dni,
and du is T dS minus p

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:05.420
dV plus i mu i dni.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:13.320
So immediately we can see that
this mu, this quantity mu that

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.930
we've defined as the derivative
of G with respect

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:22.080
to the n's, we can write many
other equations for mu.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.880
There are many other
ways to derive it.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.020
Because this is the differential
for H. This is

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.820
the first derivative of H
with respect to entropy.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.290
This is the derivative of H
with respect to pressure.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.840
And this is the derivative
of H with respect to n.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.320
Just formally, that's
what it is.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.020
When you write a differential.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:52.430
So formally, this is also mu i,
is dH/dni, keeping, now, we

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.590
have to be very careful, keeping
the entropy and the

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.410
pressure constant.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.900
Because those are
the variables.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.430
Keeping the entropy, and the
pressure, and all the other

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:08.890
n's, constant.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:16.190
We can also write it as
dA/dni, keeping the

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.520
temperature and the
volume constant.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:27.570
And all the other n's, or we
can write it as du/dni,

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:34.400
keeping that this entropy and
the volume, and all the other

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.420
n's, constant.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:42.060
So we have many ways to write
the chemical potential.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:51.460
They give you all
the same result.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.900
So this is the formal.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:59.640
Sort of the formal part of
the chemical potential.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.530
Now, what we really want to
show is that the chemical

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.240
potential really is connected
to the Gibbs

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.060
free energy per mole.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.490
That's going to be
the useful part.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:27.740
Let me get rid of this here.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.610
So I said earlier, at the
beginning of the lecture, that

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.880
the Gibbs free energy per mole
was so important, we were

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.010
going to call it the
chemical potential.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.510
And I said that here.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.950
And then I said, well,
we're going to define

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:40.690
this here, the chemical.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:44.450
But I haven't equated
the two yet.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.710
I haven't proven to you that
in fact this quantity here,

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.610
which we've formally defined
as the derivative of G with

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.045
respect to n, is the Gibbs
free energy per

00:28:53.045 --> 00:28:54.930
mole, for this species.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:03.010
In fact, what we want to show
is that if I take the sum of

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:08.260
all the chemical potentials,
times the number of moles per

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:15.410
species, that that is the
total Gibbs free energy.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:19.480
In other words, that the
chemical potential for one

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:25.390
species in the mixture is the
Gibbs free energy per mole for

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.960
that species.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.280
Once we have that idea, then
we'll be able to talk about

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.450
the concept of chemical
potential as this thing that

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.360
we can use to look
at equilibrium.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.430
To look at going downhill
for the species.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.340
To see why the cell bursts
and all these things.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.420
Because now we understand that
Gibbs free energy is so

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.170
important for equilibrium.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.680
We don't understand that
quite yet, with

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.510
the chemical potential.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.690
So we got to make that
relation here.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:58.120
We need to go from the formal
definition to a relation that

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.170
we can understand better,
because it includes the Gibbs

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.810
free energy.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:07.670
OK, so that's our goal now.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.790
So let's see.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:09.920
Let's formally do this now.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.360
Let's define, let's
derive this.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:15.670
OK.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:21.890
So remember, our goal in this
derivation is to show that

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.620
this is true.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.150
Or that this is true, here.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.770
And again, we're going
to start with the

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.010
simplest system possible.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.890
We're going to start with
a two component system.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:46.300
And we can easily generalize
to multi-component.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.310
And in our derivation, what
we're going to be after is,

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:51.750
we're going to start with the
Gibbs free energy, because

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.640
that's where we always
start with.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.360
And we're going to remember that
by definition, mu i is

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:04.640
dG/dni, So if somehow in our
derivation dG/dni falls out,

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.640
that would be great.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.120
Because we'll be able to replace
this derivative with

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.460
the chemical potential.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.650
So the goal was to find
something where this falls

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:17.360
out, so we can replace it with
the chemical potential.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.700
We're going to start with
the fact that G is

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.050
an extensive variable.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:24.380
So if I take G at a temperature
and pressure times

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.800
some scaling factor for the
size of my system, lambda,

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.770
number of moles of n1, lambda
times the number of moles of

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:35.250
n2, if I double the size
of the system,

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.290
lambda is equal to 2.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:38.820
If I half it, lambda
is equal to 1/2.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.290
Because it's extensive, this
is the same thing as lambda

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:46.600
times G of temperature
and pressure, n1, n2.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.190
Just rewriting the fact that
Gibbs free energy is an

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:52.390
extensive property.

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.470
And lambda is an arbitrary
number here.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.480
Arbitrary variable.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.420
Now I'm going to take the
derivative of both sides with

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.420
respect to lambda.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.550
So I'm going to take d d lambda
of this side here.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:12.010
And d d lambda of
that side here.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.070
Now, lambda here is inside
the variable here.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.900
So I'm going to have to
use the chain rule.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.760
To do this properly.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:30.290
So this is going to be dG/d
lambda n1, there's lambda

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.510
sitting in the variable
lambda n1 here, times

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:37.620
d lambda n1 d lambda.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:47.950
Plus dG/d lambda n2 times
d lambda n2 d lambda.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:49.470
Using the chain rule.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.930
And on this side here,
lambda's sitting

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:51.820
straight out here.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.370
So this is very easy.

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:55.020
This is G(T, p, n1, n2).

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:07.130
Now, this is good.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.340
Because this is what
I'm looking for.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.850
I'm looking for the derivative
of g with respect to the

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:12.850
number of moles.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.290
Because that's the chemical
potential.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:17.470
That was my goal up here, to
make sure in the derivation,

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.880
somehow, this came out.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:24.820
And so it's coming
out right there.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.460
Right here and right here.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.800
Since the number of moles
is lambda n1, that first

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.650
derivative here is just
the chemical potential

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.450
of species 1 there.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.670
So mu 1, then we have d
lambda n1 d lambda.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:43.170
Well, d lambda n1 d lambda,
that's just n1.

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:47.230
It's lambda times the number n1
that doesn't have anything

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.070
to do with lambda.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.680
So this is n1.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.900
This is the chemical potential
of species 2.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.080
Again, the derivative of lambda
n2 with respect to

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.400
lambda is just n2.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.830
And there is G here.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.260
It's a fairly simple derivation,
but it gets us

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.750
exactly what we want.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.280
An association between this
formal definition of mu, up

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.340
here, directly from taking
the differential.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.480
How much more formal can you
be, mathematically, here?

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.120
To associating this formal
definition to

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.540
the Gibbs free energy.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:34.880
Number of moles times mu 1,
number of moles times mu 2,

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:40.630
this is the Gibbs free energy
per mole of species 1.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:45.410
Gibbs free energy per
mole of species 2.

00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:49.040
The sum of all the species of
the Gibbs free energy per mole

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.200
of species i times the number
of moles of species i

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:57.850
is G. Or, mu i.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.600
Voila, we've done it.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.500
This is what we wanted.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.360
The chemical potential is the
Gibbs free energy per mole.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.120
And in the mixture, it's the
Gibbs free energy per mole of

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.800
the individual species
in that mixture.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.730
And if you want to know what
the total Gibbs free energy

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.320
is, because if you have an
equilibrium, what you care

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.240
about is the total Gibbs
free energy.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.750
It's not the Gibbs free energy
for one particular species.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.020
What's going to tell you whether
you have a minimum or

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:29.220
not in your system, whether
you're at equilibrium, where

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.500
you're at the lowest state
possible, is the total Gibbs

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.350
free energy.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.010
Now we'll be able to
manipulate chemical

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.120
potentials, of the individual
species, to get

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.810
at this number here.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.820
Any questions?

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.810
This is really, we're going
to see this over

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:51.500
and over again now.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.030
This chemical potential.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.100
This idea.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:36:04.460
And it's not an easy concept.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.560
OK, let me give you
an example, then,

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:13.140
of the water melting.

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.350
And how the chemical potential
comes in, now, instead of

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:18.470
using the chemical potential.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:30.160
Instead of the Gibbs
free energy.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.290
This is the phase transition.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:35.190
But it's not very different than
the cell bursting when

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:39.410
you put it in distilled water.

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:44.570
So, we take a glass of water
with an ice cube in it.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:47.580
H2O liquid.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.640
This is H2O solid.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.920
And I'm looking at the
melting process.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:58.470
I'm looking at a process where
I take a small number of

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.950
molecules of water from
the solid phase.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.550
And I bring them to
the liquid phase.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:10.570
And I want to know, is this
process spontaneous or in

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:17.970
equilibrium, or not possible?

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.100
Is this process going
to go on?

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.010
Is the direction of time
that this is melting.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.890
And I want to do this formally
thermodynamically.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:27.370
In terms of the chemical
potentials.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:30.750
That's going to be what we're
going to be talking about.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:35.020
So, formally then, what's going
on is, I'm taking nl

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:41.960
moles of liquid water, H2O
liquid, which is in here.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:47.520
Plus ns moles of solid water.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.670
And I'm, this is my
initial state.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:59.440
My final state is nl, plus a
small number of moles, dn, of

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:06.900
H2O liquids, H2O liquid, plus
ns minus dn, there's a

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.150
conservation of the number
of molecules here.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.880
Whatever I add to the
liquid has to come

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.040
from the solid here.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:19.440
Of H2O solid, of ice.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.210
And to know if this is
spontaneous or not, if this is

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:26.540
done under constant temperature
and pressure, what

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:31.070
variable should we look at?

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:31.900
G, right.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.640
We want to look at the
Gibbs free energy.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.260
So what is G doing during
this process here?

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.530
What is delta G here?

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.010
Well, we have a way of doing
it now, in terms of the

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:45.630
chemical potentials.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:51.720
Because we've just shown that
this is the case here.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:56.140
So G is the sum of the chemical
potentials times the

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.020
number of moles in
the species.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:07.290
Therefore, delta G is going to
be equal to mu for the number

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.240
of moles of l.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:20.320
Liquid, dn, number of moles
of liquid, plus mu s dns.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.840
So the change in G is going to
be equal to the chemical

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.700
potential times the change in
the species, which is in a

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.780
liquid form, plus the chemical
potential of the solid.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.520
Times the change in the species
in the solid form.

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.700
Now, dns is equal
to minus dnl.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.300
This is what we did
right here.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.880
You take a certain number of
moles from the solid form.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.940
You put it to the liquid form.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.490
That the dn up here.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.970
And you've got to have the
negative of it, up here.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.250
So dns is minus dnl.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:53.380
Which is minus dn.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:40:11.510
Delta G is dn times mu
l minus mu solid.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:16.800
So now we can rephrase this,
it's all rephrasing.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.300
It's all basically
the same thing.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:22.490
But, we can rephrase this
process by asking the

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:28.890
question, is the chemical
potential of the liquid

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:33.150
greater than, equal to, or
less than the chemical

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.320
potential of the solid?

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.640
Of the water in the solid.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.530
So the chemical potential of the
water in the liquid phase

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:44.160
is greater than the chemical
potential of the water in the

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.040
solid phase, mu l is greater
than mu s, then delta G

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.560
becomes positive.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:59.320
In that case, delta G is
greater than zero.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.150
And that's not going
to happen.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:06.840
On the other hand, if the
chemical potential of the

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:11.520
water molecules in the liquid
phase is smaller than the

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:16.450
chemical potential of the water
in the solid phase, mu s

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:19.870
is bigger than mu l, this
becomes a negative number.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:24.730
Delta G is less than zero.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:27.440
And this will happen
spontaneously.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.200
So that illustrates this idea,
that the chemical potential of

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.890
a species will want to go, so
the species will want to go,

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:37.410
where it can minimize its
chemical potential.

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:41.200
So in this case here, when we
have the spontaneous process

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.490
of the water, of the ice cube,
melting, you can think of it

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:47.240
as these water molecules
that are in the ice

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.350
phase looking around.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.000
They know what their chemical
potential here

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:51.670
is in the ice phase.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.290
They're looking around, they're
looking to see the

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:54.270
water phase.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.960
And they see that in the water
phase, those water molecules

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.730
have a smaller chemical
potential.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.320
They're happier.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:08.680
And so these solid water
molecules are jealous.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.500
And they want to go in
the water phase.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.870
And the ice cube's
going to melt.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.790
And it all has to do with this
difference in chemical

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.160
potentials for the water.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.060
And the same thing happens for
the water molecules that are

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.170
inside or outside of that
cell that you put in

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:25.590
the distilled water.

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:27.490
The water molecules in the
distilled water have a

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:31.400
chemical potential which is
higher than the water

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.580
molecules inside the cell.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.220
And they don't want
to be like that.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.740
They want to change, the system
wants to change, until

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.960
the water molecules couldn't
care less whether they're in

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.580
the water phase, or outside
or inside the cell.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:51.120
The system is going to change
until the water molecules have

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.850
the same chemical potential
everywhere.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:43:00.540
Where they don't have to choose
one place or the other.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.880
And so that gives us,
immediately, what we're going

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.530
to need when we talk
about equilibrium.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:09.450
Equilibrium, chemical
equilibrium, is going to be

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:13.680
where the chemical potential
of a species is the same

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.240
everywhere in the system.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.900
So at 0 degrees Celsius, one
bar, which is the melting

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:26.530
point of water, the chemical
potential of a molecule of

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:30.120
water in the ice phase and in
the liquid phase is the same.

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.620
That's the definition of
the melting point.

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:32.065
It doesn't care.

00:43:32.065 --> 00:43:33.460
It could go either way.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.950
It's an equilibrium.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:39.420
You take an ice cube, water,
liquid water, 0 degrees

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.950
Celsius, one bar.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.910
You come back three
days later.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:43.900
It's the same.

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.610
Come back a week later,
it's the same.

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:49.200
It's an equilibrium.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.050
Chemical potential of the water
species is the same

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:52.920
everywhere.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.000
It's an equilibrium.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.200
And I'm just repeating that
because this is so important.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:04.810
OK, any questions?

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:08.720
The last thing we're going to
do is to illustrate also the

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:19.150
importance of mixing to the
chemical potential.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:27.210
So I'm going to set up sort of
an arbitrary system here.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:32.390
This is kind of like the cell,
or the fish, also, idea.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:35.790
I'm going to put a system where
on one side I have a

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:41.295
pure gas, A. On the other side,
I have a mixture of A

00:44:41.295 --> 00:44:46.110
and B. And here is going to be
a membrane that only allows A

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:51.450
to go through.

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:54.710
Only A can go through
that membrane.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.215
They're going to be partial
pressures in here, p prime B,

00:44:57.215 --> 00:45:01.930
and p prime A. For the gas
pressures on that side, and

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:05.340
pressure on that side
is p sub A.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:11.240
And my goal in this example
here is to show that if I

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:16.970
compare the chemical potential
of a species in a mixture,

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:23.320
where the temperature and the
pressure total are T and p,

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.150
and I compare that to the
chemical potential of the same

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:31.040
species when it's pure, when
it's not mixed with anything

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.560
else, under the same temperature
and pressure

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:41.110
conditions, that, in fact that
that equals sign is not there.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:42.240
That's not what I'm
trying to show.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.230
I'm trying to show
that there's a

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:47.370
less-than sign right here.

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:51.640
To show that if you take, again,
this is the cell idea.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:55.050
If you take the water and the
distilled water, under

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:56.140
constant temperature
and pressure

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.400
conditions, it's pure.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.240
And it's looking at the cell.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.356
And inside the cell is
there, boy, is there

00:46:03.356 --> 00:46:04.820
a mixture of things.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.730
There's salts, there are
proteins, there are all sorts

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:10.670
of things, right?

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:12.350
It's a mixed system.

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:14.230
The water in that mixed
system, under the same

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.910
temperature and pressure
conditions, the chemical

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:19.970
potential of that water
molecule is less.

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.560
And that's just an
entropy thing.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.080
Entropy wants to increase.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:32.940
It just wants to be in a
place with high energy.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.240
It's the Gibbs free energy.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.240
Gibbs free energy has
enthalpy and entropy

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.230
incorporated into it.

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.860
The enthalpy's not
doing anything.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.820
It's all driven by entropy.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:49.250
So this is what we're going
to try to show.

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.960
And I'm not going to
get to it today.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.180
We'll start with it
on Wednesday.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:47:01.250
And I'll let your ruminate on
this for the next few days.
