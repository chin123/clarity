00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.160
OK, so we ended up last time, we
talked about Joule-Thomson

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.330
expansion, which is an
irreversible expansion through

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
a nozzle, through
a porous plug,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.720
constant enthalpy expansion.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.040
And I want to make sure
everybody figured out that it

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.740
really was an irreversible
expansion.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.880
Anybody have any questions on
that, because when we voted,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.830
the majority of the class
thought it was reversible Yes.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.182
STUDENT: Just a quick question
on some of the constraints,

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.926
like isothermal, isobaric,
isovolumetric expansion.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:58.080
For isothermal expansion, that
means that delta u does not

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.730
change, but delta q is
equal to delta w?

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.640
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: So the
question was, for an

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.350
isothermal expansion, delta u
does not change, therefore, dq

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.910
is equal to dw.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.790
The answer is that's true
only for an ideal gas.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.360
For a real gas, that
won't be true.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.550
Ideal gas only depends on the
temperature, the energy only

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.970
depends on the temperature.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.505
Therefore, if it's isothermal,
the energy of the ideal gas

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:25.070
doesn't change.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.038
For a real gas it depends on
more than the temperature

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:31.712
STUDENT: Are there any other
constraints similar to that

00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:37.330
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.055
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: So, for an
ideal gas, the isothermal is

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.370
the easy one because the
energy doesn't change.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.450
If you have an isobaric you're
going to have to calculate

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.310
where the energy changes, and
that's a calculation that's

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.610
likely on the homework
and very like on an

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.970
exam as well, too.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.090
In fact, we're going to do
some of that today, OK,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.270
calculate delta u.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.160
Any other questions?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.530
Good question.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.850
OK, so we ended up last time
showing that for an ideal gas,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.620
that there was was a
relationship between the heat

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.110
capacity under constant
pressure, and this is the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.360
molar heat capacity, that's why
we have the bar on top,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.020
and the molar heat capacity
for constant volume path.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.780
They're related through
the gas constant.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.860
OK, this is only true for an
ideal gas, and we went through

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.180
that mathematically where
the, with a chain rule.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.100
And I wanted to do it a
different way which is a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.990
little bit convoluted, but it
introduces the idea of a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.080
thermodynamic cycle, and it's
something that we're going to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.430
use a lot in the class.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.780
Because anytime you're working
with the function of state,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.400
and you're trying to connect two
points together in a p-V

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.020
or a T-V diagram, then it
doesn't matter which way

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.260
you're connecting those two
points, as long as you're

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.100
dealing with state functions
it doesn't matter.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.930
It only matters if you're
looking at the work or the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.040
heat right.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.900
And so sometimes, when you want
to calculate what the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.330
energy is at the endpoint, the
path of the experiment that

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.620
you're doing may not be an
easy path to calculate.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.170
You may have to find a different
path which is an

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.810
easier one to calculate, and it
doesn't matter which path

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.450
you take, because in the end
all you care is what the

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.980
energy is at the end.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.770
so we're going to use this
concept of the path to go from

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.700
the initial point to
the end point.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.310
As long as you're dealing with
state functions it doesn't

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.630
matter to get at the
same results here.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.100
So we're going to start with a
mole of gas, at some pressure,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.405
some volume, temperature and
some mole so V, doing it per

00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:46.460
mole, and we're going to
do two paths here.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.660
We're going to take a constant
volume path.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.550
So V is constant and we're going
to change the pressure

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.170
to some, a little change in
pressure, V is constant here,

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.920
and then temperatures is
also going to change.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.520
So this is a path, which is
either a temperature change,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.160
with the pressure changes at
the same time, going up or

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.170
down, constant volume.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.606
And since the temperature is
changing, clearly Cv is going

00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:15.220
to have something
to do with this.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.990
So constant volume path, where
the temperature is changing.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:24.040
So somehow this is going
to allow us to get Cv.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.030
Cv is going to be related
to this path.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.350
And if I draw a diagram on a T-V
diagram of what I'm doing

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.130
here, so there's temperature
axis.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.020
There's the volume axis here.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.580
I'm starting with
some V1 here.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.170
And this is going to
be here V plus dV.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.100
So I'm starting right here.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.100
This is my initial point.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.610
And the path that I'm describing
then, let's assume

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.660
that we're raising the
temperature up is this path

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.110
right here.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.060
OK, this is my constant
volume path going

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.780
from T to T plus dT.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.920
OK, we'll call this 1 here.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.810
All right, now I want to make a
path where out of that path,

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.450
C sub p is going to fall out.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.570
So that's going to have to be
a constant pressure path.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.880
Temperature is going to
change but pressure

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.270
is going to be constant.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.660
So what I can do is I can take
my initial point here and

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.720
create a new, different path,
where, which is going to be a

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.560
constant pressure path.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.210
So at the end of this path
the pressure is constant.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.130
The volume is going to change
though, to some new volume dV

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.995
and the temperature is going to
change also and I'm going

00:05:39.995 --> 00:05:42.820
to make it the same endpoint
temperature as the endpoint

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.020
temperature here.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.500
And out of this path, since the
pressure is constant but

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.630
the temperature is changing, I'm
hoping that C sub p will

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.260
fall out of that path
of that calculation.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.290
All right?

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.080
This should give us something
about C sub p.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.470
So this will give us something
about C sub v. This will give

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.610
us something about C sub p.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.400
Now these two endpoints
here are different.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.060
They have a different pressure,
a different volume.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.770
They do have the same
temperature though.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.790
So the connection between
this endpoint here,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.580
and that one here.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.520
Same temperature.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.320
It's going to be an isothermal
path that's

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.270
going to connect them.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.760
So I'm going to connect them in
an isothermal way, and as,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.740
since I'm dealing with an ideal
gas, and as we saw from

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.270
the first question here,
isothermal always means delta

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.270
u equals zero.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.090
So I'm going to write that
immediately here, delta u

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.010
equal zero, because I know the
answer to that path here.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.040
All right, so let's go again
what our paths are.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.290
Path number 1 I'm
going straight

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.740
up in the V-T diagram.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.100
Path number 2 on my diagram it's
a reversible, this path

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.900
number 2, it's a reversible
constant pressure path.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.820
So I'm going to be keeping the
pressure constant, but my

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:02.450
volume is going to go up.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.910
My temperature is
going to go up.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:11.380
Basically I'm putting
heat in this system.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.590
That's going to be number
2 right here.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.400
It's going to be the same
temperature as before but the

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.370
volume is V plus dV now.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.830
That's 2, and then, so I'm
heating up the system in this

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.100
path here, and then to connect
the 2 endpoints here, I'm

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.440
going to connect them through
a constant temperature path.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.300
Basically I'm going to cool down
the system so that the --

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.060
no, I'm not going to cool down,
I'm going to compresses

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.090
the system back to the smaller
volume V1 and the constant

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.560
temperature conditions.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.970
So that's path number 3 here.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.710
And I'm only going to
worry about energy

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.850
in this case here.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.850
Because I know energy doesn't
care about the path.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.400
Energy only cares about where
I am on the diagram.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.000
And I know energy is related to
Cv through Cv dT etcetera.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.540
So if I worry about energy I
have a pretty good chance of

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.030
extracting out these heat
capacities, right, and I don't

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.830
have to worry about exactly
which path and I can really

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.490
mix things up.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:21.180
So let's start the process.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:28.960
So the first path then, the
first path, constant volume

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.030
constant V, so I'm going
to, again, let's

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.000
just worry about energy.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.320
So du for this first path here,
du for path 1, and write

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.280
dq plus dw what we
usually write.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.170
Now it's constant volume when
the volume is constant.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.210
There's no work being done
so I can immediately

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.820
ignore this dw here.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.070
Constant volume dq = Cv dT.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.100
Now it's an ideal gas.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.250
So in some sense, I did too
much work by writing this,

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.500
because I knew already
du = Cv dT.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.970
I could have written that down
immediately, but I just went

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.540
through the process of writing
the first law, what's dw, what

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.116
dq, Cv dT, etcetera.

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:13.250
I'm just writing what we
already know basically.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.670
Let's look at path number 2.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.880
Path number 2.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.000
OK, let's look at the dw, du
again. du for path number 2.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.870
dq like the first law down, dq
plus dw, then -- what's dq?

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.770
Well it's a constant pressure
path. dq is related to the

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.995
temperature, the change in
temperature. dT through the

00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:37.180
heat capacity, happens to be
constant pressure, so this is

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.420
exactly what we want.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.712
Cp, I forgot to put my little
bar on top here because it's

00:09:41.712 --> 00:09:46.410
per mole Cp dT that's
my dq here.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.660
The path is constant pressure.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.500
And then the dw.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.210
Well there's a change now
in volume and pressure.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.690
So I need, well the pressure
is constant, but there's a

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:54.580
change in volume.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.690
Minus p dV is the change,
is the work, right?

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:07.820
So I can write that down minus
p dV for that path there.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.320
OK, now but it's an ideal gas,
so I know something about the

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.080
relationship between dV
and dT, because I've

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.320
got dT here the dV.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.890
I don't want to have so
many variables around.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.130
I've got three variables, T, p
and V. I know I only need 2,

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.950
so I can relate dV to dp through
the ideal gas law.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.870
P dV is equal to R dT.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:34.770
pV = RT for 1 mole, so I just
take dV here. dT here because

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:43.190
the pressure is constant, so
dV is equal to R over p dT.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.150
Then pressure is constant.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.730
So I can instead of the
dV here, I can insert

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.940
this R over p dT.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:11:00.970
The p's cancel out, and now
I have Cp dT minus R dT.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.480
This is equal to
Cp minus R dT.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.980
All right, let's complete
the cycle now, the

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.760
path number 3 here.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.080
Path number 3 is a constant
temperature path, and I

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.260
already wrote the answer.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.310
Constant temperature isothermal
delta u is zero.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.440
There's no thinking involved.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.040
It's one of these things like
I mentioned last time, if I

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.350
tell you delta H in the middle
of the night what you say, q

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.170
Cp for reversible process.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.680
Same thing here. isothermal
process, what do you say?

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.900
Delta u is zero, right?

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.590
It should be completely
second nature.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.200
So delta u is zero here.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.040
Delta u sub 3 is, for
an ideal gas.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.900
I gotta put that constraint
in there for an ideal gas.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.370
Delta u is equal to zero.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.060
So now I'm back at
the same place.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.090
I'm back here right.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:58.610
So path number 1 went from i,
let's call this path up here.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.870
went to f, and this is how much
energy change there was.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.430
The sum of path number 2 and
path number 3 get me to the

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:10.660
same place, so the energy change
by going through this

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.410
time path, this intermediate
point here back all the way to

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.760
final state should be the
same the red path.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.530
So what I'm saying is that du
through path 1 should be equal

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:30.200
to du through path 2 plus
du going through path 3.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.940
All right, because energy
doesn't care about the path.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.350
It only cares about
the end points.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.550
OK, so now let's plug what
is du through path 1?

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:47.440
It's Cp dT and the du through
path 2 is Cp minus R dT and

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.950
then du through path
3 is zero.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.810
It's the isothermal process.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:56.110
The dT is cancelled out and
voila I have my answer.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:04.820
Cv is equal, oh Cv plus R is
equal to Cp whichever way you

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.280
want to do it, it's a
relationship that we had up

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.990
here that we wanted to prove.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:18.110
Now, I wanted to go to through
this just to go through one

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.570
cycle quickly because we're
going to be doing these all

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.140
the time, and the importance
of the fact that the path

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.360
doesn't matter, and you can
always connect things together

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.590
in a way, whatever you want.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.340
Whatever is the easiest.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.970
If you want to calculate
a change in delta u.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.670
Now if you look at my derivation
here, there's one

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.780
spot where I could have just
stopped and proven my point

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.780
without going through
the whole thing.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.750
So if you look at path number 2
here, the constant pressure

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:51.240
path du is Cp minus R
dT, du is Cp minus

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.900
r dT for that path.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.810
What is du for an ideal gas?

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.350
It's -- what else do we know
that du is always equal to for

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.470
an ideal gas?

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.470
Cv dT right.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:08.140
So I could have written right
here immediately equals Cv dT,

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.010
and that was the end
of my derivation.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:10.830
I could have done that.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.410
It would've been easier, but I
wanted to go through the whole

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.490
path right?

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:23.850
OK, any questions?

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:24.340
Cool.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.590
All right, so we're going
to be doing more

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.750
thermodynamics processes.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.210
We're building up to entropy
and to engines,

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.430
Carnot cycles, etcetera.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.850
And so we need to build our
repertoire of knowledge in

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:41.070
manipulating these cycles like
the one I drew on the board

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.840
that's hidden now You've
already seen the simple

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.510
process, which is the isothermal
process, and you've

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.620
seen how to functionalize, or
what the function is that

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.620
describes the isothermal
expansion.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:01.520
Let's say we start from some
V1 and p1 here, so high

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.920
pressure, small volume and we
end up with a high volume low

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.780
pressure, under constant
temperature condition.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:19.480
So there's some path,
isothermal, so T is constant.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:25.240
And we know the functional form
for this path, it's the

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.360
ideal gas law, pV
= RT, pV = nRT.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:35.965
T is constant, so the functional
form here is pV is

00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:38.770
equal to a constant.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:45.380
All right, or p is equal to a
constant divided by volume.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.280
If you want to write a function
that describes this

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.180
line here, it's pressure as a
function of volume related to

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.360
each other with this constant.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.290
So we know how to do this.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.210
So this allows us to calculate
all sorts of things to get

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.050
these functional forms.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.060
That's the isotherm here.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.750
We also know how to calculate
the work.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:07.170
If it's a reversible process,
we know the work is the area

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:13.370
under the curve. w reversible.
in this case here let's see

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:17.570
this is it's a pressure
is going down.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:22.180
It's an expansion, so we're
doing work against the

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.950
environment, or to
the environment.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.080
So work is leaving the system.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:32.180
So minus w reversible is going
to be a positive number.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:37.460
V1 to V2 and RT -- you've done
this already last time or a

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:45.200
couple of times ago and you end
up with minus nRT log p2

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.080
over p1, OK?

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.890
So minus w reversible, we're
doing work to the environment.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:54.260
This should be a positive
number. p2 is less than p1, so

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.940
p2 over p1 is less than one, log
of something less than 1

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.150
is negative times negative.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.040
So in fact this is indeed a
positive number so we didn't

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.130
make a mistake in our signs.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.460
You always want to check your
signs at the and because it's

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:10.190
so easy to get the sign wrong,
and I was hoping that it was

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.750
right here because I
wasn't sure, but it

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.520
turned out to be right.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.120
Always check your
sign at the end.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.580
All right so we know
how to do this.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.440
Now we are going to do the same
thing with a different

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:19.940
constraint.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.290
Our constraint is going to be
an adiabatic expansion or

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:23.950
compression.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.960
Adiabatic meaning there's no
heat involved, and we're going

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.390
to see how that differs from the
isothermal expansion and

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.000
compression.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.610
OK, so this is the
experiment then.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.740
We're going to take a
piston here which

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.350
is going to be insulated.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.240
It's going to have some volume,
temperature to begin

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.570
with, and then we're going
to do something to it.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.130
We're going to change the
pressure above, right now

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:59.270
there's a p external, which is
equal to p on the inside.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.790
OK, we're going to do this
reversibly, which means we're

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.270
going to slowly change the
external pressure very, very

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.040
slightly at a time, so that at
every point we're basically in

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.430
equilibrium, until the pressure
reaches a new smaller

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.850
pressure p2.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:21.640
So that's going to results in
an expansion where the new

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.240
volume new temperature new
pressure and an external

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.730
pressure, which is p2 which
is a smaller pressure.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.730
It's really important that this,
that you remember that

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.470
this is the reversible case.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.730
We're going to also look at the
irreversible case briefly.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:42.590
So on the p-V diagram, then,
there's a V1 here a V2 here, a

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.210
p1 here a p2 here.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:49.830
This V2 is going to be different
than this one here.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.250
A priori we don't
know what it is.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.680
We don't know if it's
bigger or smaller.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.810
We kind of feel like it's going
to be different because

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:56.840
it's a different constraint.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.200
This is isothermal.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.300
This is adiabatic,
there's no heat.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.340
So there's going to be a line
that's going to connect the

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:08.540
initial point to the final
point, and that line

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.050
mathematically is not going to
be the same as this one here.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.620
And our job is to find out
what is the mathematical

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:19.420
description of this path, this
line in p-V's case that

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.200
connects these two point.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.250
And again, I want to stress
this is a reversible path.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:32.730
If it was non-reversible, I
would be allowed to put an

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.450
initial point and a final
point, but I wouldn't be

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.060
allowed to put a path between
them like this, connecting

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.570
them together.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.230
Because if it's irreversible,
it's very likely that I don't

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.510
know what the pressure inside
the system is doing while this

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.030
is happening.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.200
It could be very chaotic.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.860
The pressure could not be, might
not even be constant

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.900
throughout the system.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.110
It could have eddies and
all sorts of things.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.340
So for an irreversible process,
I wouldn't really be

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.830
allowed to put a path there.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.670
I can do that because it's
reversible, and I can get a

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.130
functional form out.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:09.110
What we're going to find in
this process is that the

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.070
functional form from this is
that p is related to the

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.380
volume through a constant, but
instead of being V to the

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.820
first power as it was for the
isothermal, it's now a V to

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.480
some constant gamma.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:31.620
What we're going to find is that
gamma is greater than 1.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:39.440
And if gamma is greater than
1, and you're changing the

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.990
pressure to the same final
point, what we're going to

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.450
find then is the volume that
you go to is going to be a

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.030
smaller volume than for
the isothermal.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.350
We're going to go through these
points, so don't worry

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.130
about getting at all
straight right now.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.120
All right, so let's do this.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.370
Let's try to show this.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.900
Let's try to show that in fact
this is the right functional

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.990
form, that pV to the gamma is
equal to constant is the right

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.880
form that describes the path in
an adiabatic expansion or

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.270
compression.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.970
So let's do the experiment.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.940
Let's write everything
that we know down.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.630
This is where, the way that we
should start every problem set

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.110
or ever problem.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:23.760
It's writing everything we
know and what it means.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.250
OK, so adiabatic.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.050
All the words mean things
mathematically.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.850
Adiabatic means dq
equals zero.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:38.280
Let's write that down.
dq equals zero.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:38.940
Reversible.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:44.550
Reversible means that if I
looked at dw it's minus p

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.310
reversible.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.940
It's minus p external dV, that's
what it is, but in the

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:56.690
reversible process p external
is equal to p.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.110
That's the only time you can set
p external equal to p is

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.580
if it's reversible.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.710
So this is the external
pressure.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.130
This is the internal pressure
of the system.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.830
You can only do this because
it's reversible.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:10.950
What else do I know?

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.790
It's an ideal gas.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:24.660
So I can write du is Cv dT
and pV is equal to RT.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.540
OK.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.170
So what else can I write?

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:42.220
Well from the first law, du is
equal to dq plus dw, and I

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.600
wrote down everything I knew
at the beginning here.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.900
I wrote dq equals zero
I wrote what dw was.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.320
So du is just minus p dV.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.540
Now from the ideal gas,
I have another

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.260
expression for du, Cv dT.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.360
So now I have two expressions
for du.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.440
That's a good thing, because I
can them equal to each other.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:08.250
So if you get these two guys
together you get Cv dT is

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.170
minus p dV.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.540
So we're connecting temperature
and changes in

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:21.780
temperature and changes
in volume together.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.380
OK, now we don't really
want this p here.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.750
This is going to be a function,
I only need two

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.670
variables, and here I've got
three variables down.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.240
So I know p is going to be a
function of T and V, and I

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.740
know how to relate p to
T and V because I know

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.040
the ideal gas law.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:44.230
So instead of p, here I'm going
to put nRT over V. or RT

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.980
over V bar.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:56.640
So now, this expression becomes
Cv dT over T is equal

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:05.210
to minus R dV over V. And I
also did a little bit of

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.980
rearrangement.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.748
Yes?

00:24:06.748 --> 00:24:22.100
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.920
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: Well, let's
see. du is, for an ideal gas,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.240
it's always equal to Cv dT.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.580
Constant volume process tells
you that if you have a

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.440
constant volume, then
dq is Cv dT.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.970
This is what the constant volume
path tells you, that

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.770
you can equate Cv dT with dq.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:45.620
The ideal gas tells you that
this is always true here.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.920
It's an ideal gas in adiabatic
expansion dq is equal to zero.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.500
Adiabatic expansion means you
can't use this. dq is zero.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.690
The that is adiabatic.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.890
It's not constant volume.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.680
You're allowed Cv comes out
here for this adiabatic

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.090
expansion, which is not a
constant volume only because

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.510
this is always true
for an ideal gas.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.740
We didn't use a constraint
that V is constant.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:16.640
Just use this as an
ideal gas here.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.620
OK, so we've got dT
here dV here.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.250
We want to get rid
of derivatives.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.850
We want to integrate.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.620
So let's take the integral of
both sides, going from the

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.220
initial point to the
final point.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:35.750
We've got Cv integral from T1
to T2, dT over T is equal to

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:44.050
minus R from V1 to V2 dV over
V. OK, we do take that

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:51.600
integral, and that leads us to
Cv log of T2 over T1 is equal

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:58.150
to minus R log of V2 over V1,
and now we know how to

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.950
rearrange this, because the Cv
times a log of T2 over T1 is

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.360
the same thing as the
log of T2 over T1 to

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.820
the Cv power, right.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:12.480
So by rearranging these
expression of the logs here,

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.660
this is the same thing is
writing log T2 over T1 to the

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:25.110
Cv power is equal to log of
V1 over V2 to the R power.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.910
And I've reversed the fraction
here because of the

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:33.780
negative sign here.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:43.080
OK, get rid of the logs, and
you get that T2 over T1 is

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:52.390
equal to V1 over V2 to the R
over Cv by taking this Cv and

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:56.520
bringing it on the
other side here.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.780
OK, so now we've got the initial
and final points, a

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.530
relationship between the
temperature and volume for the

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:08.320
initial and final points.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.650
Eventually that's not
what we want.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.830
Eventually we want the same
relationship in the pressure

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:13.430
and volume.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:18.600
We want a relationship in p-V
space, not in T-V space.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.870
So we're going to have to
do something about that.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.670
But first, it turns out that
now we have this R over Cv.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:27.260
and remember, we have this
relationship between R Cv and

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.680
Cp here, which is going
to be interesting.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:36.630
So let's get rid of R in
this expression here.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:41.280
So R over Cv, R is
Cp minus Cv.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.950
We proved that first thing this
morning, divided by Cv so

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:52.700
this is Cp over Cv minus 1 and
because I know the answer of

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.510
this whole thing here, I'm going
to call this thing here,

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.440
Cp over Cv.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.280
I'm going to call it gamma.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.530
Because I know the
answer, right.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:02.980
I know the answer.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.070
I'm going to call this gamma.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:13.520
By definition I'm going to
define gamma by Cp over Cv by

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.180
definition.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.730
OK, so that means that this is
really instead of R over Cv.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.410
it's really gamma minus one.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:29.300
So now I've got this gamma
placed in there, gamma minus

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.960
1, so I've ben feeling
a little bit better.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.350
I've gotten V to the gamma
power almost to the gamma

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.640
power, it's minus 1 here.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.120
But it's almost right and I'm
looking for something like

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.550
this here, V to the gamma power
pV to the gamma power is

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.880
a constant to describe
that line.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.580
So I just got to get rid
of the temperature now.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.450
Somehow I've gotta get rid of
the temperature and make it

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:58.260
pressure instead.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:04.500
OK, so let's -- let me get rid
of this here, let's use the

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.230
ideal gas law to get rid
of the temperature.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:17.800
So we have T is pV over R. So
now if I look at my V1 over V2

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:24.360
to the gamma minus 1,
that's T2 over T1.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.750
I'll replace the ideal gas
law for those two T's.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:34.770
That p2 V2 over R, and then I
have p1 V1 over R, the R's

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.620
cancel out.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.390
Well let's see, there's a V1
over V2 to the gamma minus 1.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.790
There's a V1 over V2
here or V2 over V1.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.470
That's going to get rid
of this minus 1 here.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:49.180
Then I'm going to get, be
left with a p2 over p1.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.650
So this guy here gets rid of
this, and I have my answer as

00:29:54.650 --> 00:30:01.860
V1 over V2 to the gamma power
is equal to p2 over p1.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:08.630
Or I can re-write this as p1, V1
to the gamma is equal to p2

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.310
V2 to the gamma.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:18.750
That means that p1 and -- where
I am, the point number 1

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.150
and point number 2 were
completely arbitrary.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.390
They happen to be on the path.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:30.060
So any point I pick on that path
will be equal to p1, V1

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:30.570
to the gamma.

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:34.400
So if I take p times V to the
gamma, anywhere on the path,

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.350
it's going to be equal
to the same relation

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.140
from my first point.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.590
This is going to be true for
any point on the path.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:44.000
As long as I'm on the path, pV
to the gamma will be whatever

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.110
it was for the first point,
which is going to be some sort

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:52.130
of constant.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:53.540
All right, so I've
proven my point.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.750
I've proven what I was trying to
do, which was to show that

00:30:55.750 --> 00:31:03.230
on this adiabat, everywhere on
the adiabat, if you take a

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.500
functional form that relates p
and V together, it's going to

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.540
have this relationship with
gamma as related to the heat

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.570
capacities.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:18.020
Gamma is Cp over Cv.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:26.660
OK, now there's more we can say
because we know that's Cp

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.533
is related to Cv through
this R here, and R

00:31:28.533 --> 00:31:30.310
is a positive number.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:34.610
So Cp is always bigger
than Cv.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:42.810
In fact, if it's an ideal gas
Cv and Cp are well defined

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.530
numbers, it turns out.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:56.970
If you have a monotomic ideal
gas, OK, so an atomic version,

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:02.330
not a molecular ideal gas, then
it turns out that Cv is

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:09.380
equal to 3/2 R, and therefore,
Cp which is just R plus this

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.430
is five halves R, which means
that gamma for a mono atomic

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:17.470
ideal gas is 5/3.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:22.630
So if you have a gas of argon
atoms, you know what gamma is.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.490
This is something that you're
going to prove in statistical

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.870
mechanics, and so we're not
going to worry about where

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:29.840
this comes from.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.200
We're just going to take
it for granted.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.190
All right, so gamma is for ideal
gas, is bigger than one.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:38.820
In fact we have a number
for it if it's an

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.790
atomic ideal gas.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:47.030
So what it means then is if I
look at if this relationship

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.780
here, gamma is bigger than 1,
so gamma something bigger

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.460
than 1 minus 1.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:56.440
This is, so this is
positive here.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.820
It's positive.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:04.480
So if I have an expansion where
V2 is greater than V1,

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:15.510
so V2 is greater than V1, so
this is a number which is less

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:24.860
than one, then I expect then T2
is going to be less and T1,

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:29.630
T2 is less than T1.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:37.800
OK, I have this number here to
a power, which is positive, a

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.160
positive power.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.760
And its number is
less than one.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.970
This is going to give
me something which

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.060
is less than one.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:49.090
So T2 is less than T1, and I
have a cooling of a gas.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:54.490
So whenever you have an
adiabatic expansion, the

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.980
temperature cools,
it gets colder.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:06.740
It gets colder, and if I look at
my graph here, then if the

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:11.925
volume of the expansion, if
the temperature of the

00:34:11.925 --> 00:34:18.120
adiabatic expansion was colder,
that means that --

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.540
this is the wrong graph here.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.710
If I want to compare it with
the isothermal expansion,

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:32.320
which is sitting here.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:41.650
All right, so gamma, the gas is
cooling so V2 is going to

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:44.080
be less than it what
would be if the

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.050
temperature kept constant.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.720
So finally, on the same graph,
I put down what an isothermal

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:53.650
expansion would be, if my final
pressure is the same

00:34:53.650 --> 00:35:02.570
pressure, my volume for an
isothermal expansion will be

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:08.530
bigger than for an adiabatic
expansion.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.950
So when I expand this gas
adiabatically and it cools

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:16.650
down, why do you think
it might cool down?

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:19.270
It cools down because I'm
doing work through the

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:23.360
environment, but the energy has
to go somewhere, right?

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.440
There's an interplay between
the energy inside the gas

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.480
which is the heat energy which
is allowing me to do all that

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.100
work to be outside, and so I'm
using up some of the energy

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.420
that's inside the gas to do
the work on the outside.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:42.980
And here, in an isothermal
expansion, The bath is putting

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:49.380
back the energy that the gas
is expanding or using to

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.620
expand, and so the energy is
flowing back into the gas

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:59.310
through the environment in
the isothermal expansion.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:02.800
In the opposite case, if you
have a compression, then it's

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.750
the opposite of expansion.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:08.300
Compression you're expected
to heat up, right?

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.880
So in the compression, you're
going to have V2

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.720
is less than V1.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:19.420
So that T2 is going to
be greater than T1.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.990
That's going to be your
heating up of the gas.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:25.860
And that really is
the bicycle pump.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.410
That example I gave last time
with the bicycle pump was not

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:30.330
quite the right example.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.900
But this time this really
is the bicycle pump.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.350
That you're pushing
really hard on it.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.650
So you start with the
bicycle pump at one

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.060
bar, let's say, right?

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.760
And you compress the air
in the bicycle pump.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:48.060
You do it so quickly that the
heat flow between the inside

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.700
of the bicycle pump and the
outside is too slow compared

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.620
to the speed at which
you compress.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.770
But you don't compress it so
quickly that you're not in

00:36:55.770 --> 00:37:01.100
there reversible process so you
compress that if you were

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.590
to feel the temperature of the
air and you can feel it

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:07.010
through the nozzle gives you an
idea of the temperature of

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.080
the air inside your
bicycle pump.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.360
You'll feel that it's warmer.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.290
You've just done an adiabatic
compression of the ideal gas,

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.300
you can pretend there
is an ideal gas.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:19.040
And that gives rise to
the heating that you

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.160
can actually measure.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:36.930
OK, any questions on
this part here.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:41.470
All right, so we've just gone
through the reversible

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:46.140
adiabatic, and I'm not going
to do this in detail, but I

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.200
want to go through the
irreversible adiabatic fairly

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:58.000
quickly, and see where the
difference is here.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.960
OK, so now we're going to do the
same kind of experiment,

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.270
but irreversibly.

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:09.270
An irreversible adiabatic.

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:17.870
OK, so the experiment is going
to be to take my cylinder now,

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.480
and the external pressure and
the internal pressure are not

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.680
going to be in equilibrium
with each

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.180
other during the process.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.890
I'm going to start with my
cylinder here, I'm going to

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:29.460
put little pegs here so
it doesn't fly up.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.970
There's going to be some
external pressure.

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:32.140
I'm going to set that
equal to p2.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.410
There is going to be an internal
pressure where p1 is

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:40.360
less than p2 and there's
V1 and T1 here.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.170
The whole thing is going
to be insulated.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:48.170
Then I'm going to release these
little pegs here and my

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:50.730
piston is going to shoot
up now because p2

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:52.300
is less than p1.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.790
So p2 is less than p1, the
external pressures is less

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:58.660
than the internal pressure.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.220
So it's going to shoot up until
the internal pressure

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.190
and the external pressure
are in equilibrium.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:13.300
So they're both p2. external is
p2 and I have p2, V2, T2,

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.470
on the other side.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:28.640
OK, so in my diagram now, I have
p1, V1 for my gas. p2, V2

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.560
for my gas, so I know that I'm
starting here and I know that

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.930
I'm ending here, but I can't
connect this path here.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.470
I don't know how to do that.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:41.950
It's an irreversible
expansion.

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.160
I don't know what the
pressure is doing in

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.030
there, doing that expansion.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.100
It could be quite chaotic.

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:51.900
It could be non-spacially
constant.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:56.710
OK, so but you still know
a number of things.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.450
We're now going to be able to
write you know dw is minus p

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:01.960
dV, but we're still going
to be able to

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.520
write a bunch of things.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.890
We're still going to be able to
write that it's an adiabat

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:11.210
so that dq equals zero.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:16.530
We're still going to be able
to write dw instead of pV

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:19.980
where p is the internal
pressure. dw now is actually

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.590
much easier.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.400
It's minus p external.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.650
Well p external is actually p2,
so that makes it actually

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:29.070
easier. dV we're still
going to write that

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:29.900
it's an ideal gas.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:34.940
So du is still going to be
equal to Cv dT, and we're

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.590
still going to be able to use
the first law, all these

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:40.500
things don't matter
where the path is.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.240
Still know that du
is dq plus dw.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.390
dq is zero. dw is minus p2 dV.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.140
So this is what we know, just
like what we wrote there.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.690
We write what we know.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.610
I'm not going to turn
the crank here.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.340
I'm going to give
you the answer.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.320
OK, you use the ideal gas law,
etc., then you get a

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:05.960
relationship that connects the
pressure and the temperature,

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.720
like here we got a relationship
that connected

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.160
the temperatures and the
volumes together.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:15.630
You can get a relationship that
connects the temperature

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:27.780
so this is T2 times Cv plus R
is equal to T1 on Cv plus p2

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.810
over p1 times R.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.620
This is going to be the connect,
what connects the

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.580
pressures and the temperature.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:43.570
And p2 is less than p1, so
this number right here

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.470
is less than 1.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:50.240
So and Cv plus R, Cv plus
something less than R, so T1

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.370
better be bigger than T2.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:57.690
OK, so T2 is less than T1.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.770
Same qualitative result
as before.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.270
You have an expansion.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.060
It's and adiabatic expansion.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.750
You get a cooling of the gas.

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.560
OK?

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:13.290
Now here's a question for you
guys, which we're going to

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:18.710
vote on, so you better start
thinking about it.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:26.050
Is the temperature T2 in this
process smaller or larger than

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:31.250
if I were to do the process
reversibly with the same

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:35.120
endpoint pressure.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.100
So now, instead of having p
external equals to p2 here, I

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:42.970
put p1 and I let this whole
thing go reversibly.

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:49.760
And I compare T2 irreversible
to T2 reversible.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.130
They're both less than T1.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.400
They're supposed, there's
a cooling

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.220
happening in both cases.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.410
One is going to be colder
than the other, maybe.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:58.330
Maybe they're going
to be the same.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:42:58.750
I don't know.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:01.500
I'm going to let you try to
figure that out qualitatively

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.790
without doing any math.

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.230
See if you can figure it out.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:15.540
OK, so which is colder?

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.020
I'm going to let you think
about it for about thirty

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:35.300
seconds or so.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.000
You can talk to each
other if you don't,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:57.000
can't figure it out.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.750
All right, let's take a vote.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:01.750
How many people say that T2
irreversible is colder than T2

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:04.240
reversible?

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:14.320
One, two, don't be shy, three
four, anybody else, five.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.370
OK, I've got five votes here.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:15.710
Professor Nelson?

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:19.070
PROFESSOR NELSON: Oh,
I'm abstaining.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.190
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: You're
abstaining, OK, good choice.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:27.000
OK, what about T1
cooler than T2?

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.590
OK, I've got a lot
of votes here.

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.300
So the majority of the
people, so this is

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.160
much bigger than five.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.830
OK.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:37.900
So remember last time the
majority was wrong, right?

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.860
The majority was wrong
last time.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.580
That doesn't mean that the
majority is wrong here.

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.000
It could be right.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.660
Let me give you another piece
of information here that you

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:46.880
already know.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:54.380
Minus w irreversible, this is
the work which is done to the

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:59.300
environment by the system, minus
w irreversible is always

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.900
smaller than minus
w reversible.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.550
You learned that a
little while ago.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.630
OK, so this is a little hint.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:09.620
Let's vote again.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.520
Let's think about it for ten
seconds why this could be

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:19.410
interesting and relevant, and
I want to ask if anybody

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:22.740
changed their mind.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.530
Anybody change their mind,
change their vote?

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:27.540
Yes You want to change
your vote?

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.022
To which one?

00:45:29.022 --> 00:45:33.224
STUDENT: From T2 reversible is
greater than T2 irreversible,

00:45:33.224 --> 00:45:36.280
saying that T2 reversible
is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.440
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: So
the question then,

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.482
which one is colder?

00:45:40.482 --> 00:45:42.447
STUDENT: T2 reversible
should be colder.

00:45:42.447 --> 00:45:44.750
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: T2
irreversible should be colder?

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:47.710
STUDENT: Yes.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:49.600
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: All right.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.710
OK.

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.690
I'm going to keep you there
then, the majority.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:52.900
Yes?

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.810
STUDENT: I'm switching
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:56.720
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: You're
switching this way here?

00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:00.460
So now we have six here.

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.840
Anybody else want to switch?

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.700
All right, let's take the
example of, the extreme

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.350
example, let's go to the
extreme example where p

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:17.250
external is really small.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:22.180
And I have this adiabatic
expansion where p external is

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:26.030
really small. it's kind
of like the Joule

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:30.850
expansion, an ideal gas.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.240
What happened to the temperature
in a Joule

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.310
expansion in ideal gas?

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:37.340
Anybody remember?

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.860
Anybody remember?

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.800
Joule expansion, this is where
we proved that delta u was

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.130
only dependent on temperature.

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:51.780
Bob Field taught that lecture.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.740
Nobody remembers?

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.430
Well, all right, delta u is
equal to zero for that.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.960
What happened to the temperature
in that expansion?

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:04.080
It's an adiabatic expansion.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:04.980
Well, we'll revisit that.

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.520
Let me ask you another
question here.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:11.920
So w, the work is less for the
irreversible process than the

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.190
reversible process.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:14.960
There's less work done
to the outside.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:19.080
So there's less energy expanded
by the system.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.070
The energy expanded by the
system is smaller for the

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:23.240
irreversible process.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.150
It's not doing as much work.

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.410
It's not pressing against
as much pressure.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:31.550
Right? p external equals
p2 is less than p

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:34.300
external equals p internal.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.080
So it doesn't have to
do as much work.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.400
It doesn't have to expend as
much energy, therefore, the

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.680
majority in this
case is right.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.710
The temperature is not going
to cool as much for the

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:44.640
irreversible process.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.710
The reversible process is going
to be colder because it

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:48.000
has to expend more energy.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.840
It's going to have a
higher pressure.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.460
The pressure is going to
decrease along the way, but

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.090
it's going to have to
do more work because

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:57.260
of this right here.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.850
So the majority in this
case is right.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:01.680
Now the Joule expansion, the
temperature doesn't change, T

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:08.440
equals zero. eta sub J, the
Joule coefficient for an ideal

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:17.380
gas, is equal to zero and
eta sub J was dT/dV

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:21.210
under constant energy.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.340
All right, any questions?

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:23.730
Yes?

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:29.980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.660
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: The only
-- a priori, that's true.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:36.800
But it's hard to imagine an
irreversible compression the

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:44.540
way we can just imagine an
irreversible expansion.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:47.350
You have to do it awfully fast
to get your irreversible

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:47.800
compression.

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.790
I don't know how to
do it really.

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:54.720
I think it's, but it's more
complicated, but you're

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.230
basically right, basically
right.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:59.880
That's why we always talk about
irreversible expansion,

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.210
because it's easy
to write down an

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:02.330
irreversible expansion.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:04.680
A compression is a little
bit more complicated.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.540
Any other questions?

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.680
OK, great.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.450
Monday Professor Nelson who is
sitting here will be taking

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:18.160
over for a few weeks
and then you'll see

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.170
me again after that.
