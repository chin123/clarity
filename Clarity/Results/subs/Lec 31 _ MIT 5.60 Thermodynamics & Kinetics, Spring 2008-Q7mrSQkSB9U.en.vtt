00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.180
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.410
So last time you started
kinetics which is a completely

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.640
different topic from
thermodynamics.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.570
They're related and we'll see a
relationship at some point.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.980
And you did first
order kinetics.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.550
And today we're going to move
on and go ahead and do more

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.190
complicated kinetics and
hopefully get to some

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.890
interesting stuff in
a couple lectures.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.080
Right now we just have to do
the review of stuff that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.100
you've probably seen before.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.680
And so we're going to
go reasonably fast.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.140
So you saw first order
reactions.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.870
Today we're going to do second
order reactions.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.440
At least begin with second
order reactions.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.980
Second order kinetics.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.720
Of the form, and then
there are two kinds.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:21.410
There's first order, rather,
second order, in one reactant

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.900
of the form A goes
to products.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.700
And then you have first order
in two reactants first order

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.980
in two reactants.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:44.850
So I'll have the form A plus
B goes of products.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.960
Where that's first order in A
and first order in B, and this

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.640
is second order in A. So you can
think of this as A plus A

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.210
goes to products if you want.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.070
And there's some rate
constant k,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.860
associated with this reaction.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.380
And we do the rate analysis.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.330
We write the rate
of this process.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.580
Minus dA/dt.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.440
And for the purpose of writing
on the board, and you might

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.030
want to do this also in
your homework, when

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.320
you're tired of writing.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.130
I'm going to skip
the brackets.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.040
The little brackets that we
usually put for concentration.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.780
I'm going to skip those, because
it's just too much

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.125
work to write them.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:30.510
And you can understand that A
is a concentration of A. So

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.250
this is equal to k A squared.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.490
Second order on A. And the units
for k, it's important to

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.280
keep track of your units, at the
end of the calculations,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.030
often you want to make sure
your units work out.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.730
So the units for k are going
to be of this, A is

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.400
in moles per liter.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.600
The units for k, you're going
to have to be able to match

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.200
the units on this side here.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.070
So the units for k are going to
be liters squared per mole

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.960
squared per second.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.830
To make the units match.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.140
Then you integrate this, on both
sides, from zero to t, or

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.630
from A0, the initial rate, to A.
Or from zero to t and this

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.180
doesn't go like this.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:32.470
So integrate with A0 to A.
You've got dA over A squared,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.520
you put all the A's on one side,
all the t's on the other

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:43.160
side, from zero to t dt with a
minus k on this side here.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.420
And then you get your rate
equation, integrated rate

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.630
equation for this.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:01.240
Which gives you one over A is
equal to kt plus one over A0.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.600
So this gives you A as
a function of time.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.610
And this is a convenient way
to write it, because it's

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.410
linear in time.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.650
So you always try to get things
to be linear in time.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.360
Because then you can plot
them as a straight line.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.460
Plot on this axis here you plot
one over A. on this axis

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.650
here you plot t as a
function of time.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:34.420
And then you get a straight
line where the slope is k.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.460
Gives you the rate, and the
intercept is one over A0.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.720
Yes.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.450
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.030
PROFESSOR: k is moles per liter
squared per second.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.760
You're right, liters per
mole per second, yes.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:03.880
That is correct. because
it has to work.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.000
Otherwise it doesn't work.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.860
So I need to turn on my brain.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.530
OK, think.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.250
Liters per mole per second.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:24.630
Thank you.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.210
And the other thing that you
want to know is the half-life.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.050
What is the half-life.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.030
So you set 2 A0.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.600
So A0 over two, you look for the
time where you get to A0

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.310
over two, so you put A0
over two in here.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.110
And that's going to be equal
to k times t 1/2

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.270
plus one over A0.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.490
So you solve for the half-life
and you get a half-life

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.590
of one over k A0.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.520
So the half-life is inversely
proportional to the amount of

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.820
stuff you started out with.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.820
Unlike the first order reaction,
where the half-life

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:14.010
was independent of the amount
that you started out with.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.680
So this was the easy one.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.760
The next one is a little
bit more complicated.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:27.270
Which is when your first order
in each of two reactants.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.500
Then your rate, your
differential rate equation,

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.320
looks like this.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.240
Because the k times A times B,
and now you don't know what to

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.960
do with B, a priori.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.740
So you want to rewrite this
equation a little bit

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.350
differently in terms of the
amount of A that's used up.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.740
So you define A, x is equal to
A0 minus A, this is the amount

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.070
of A that's used up.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.120
This is what you started
out with, this is

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.990
what you're left with.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.440
And so the difference is
what's being used up.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:09.050
And dx/dt is minus dA/dt.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:15.180
And by stoichiometry, what
you've used up, of A, is also

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.310
what you've used up of B.
Because for every A that

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.575
reacts, you have to use up one
mole of B. For every mole of A

00:07:25.575 --> 00:07:28.510
that reacts, you use up one
mole of B. And so you also

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.780
have x to B0 minus B. So, you
can plug this in here.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.420
And get a differential equation
which is purely in

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.450
terms of one variable,
which is x.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.480
Right here, it looks like it's
in terms of two variables,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.730
which makes it complicated.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.160
By doing this change of
variables, you see that A and

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.370
B actually related.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.150
Because of the reaction
stoichiometry.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:59.010
So you can rewrite that as dx/dt
is equal to k times A0

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.230
minus x times B0 minus x.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.210
And now you have a differential
equation in one

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.170
variable, which with some
tricks you can solve.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.350
So we want to have the
integrated equation.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.540
So we take an integral
of both sides.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.560
We put in all the
x's on one side.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.500
All the times on
the other side.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:28.670
We'll go from x equals zero to
x, dx, A0 minus x times B0

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:34.920
minus x is equal to k
from zero to t dt.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.990
And now you have to dig back
into the last time you took

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.830
integration calculus, which
for me was about

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.600
two centuries ago.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.450
And figure out how to do
this integral here.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.430
And the trick for doing
this integral is

00:08:51.430 --> 00:09:01.640
to use partial fractions.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.510
So you use partial fractions
to do this integral here.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:13.890
Which means that if you take
this ratio, one over A0 minus

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:20.570
x times B0 minus x and rewrite
it as some number, n1 divided

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:29.200
by A0 minus x, plus some number
n2 divided by B0 minus

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.210
x, you solve for n1 and n2, and
you find that n1 here is

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:43.600
equal to one over B0 minus
A0 and n2 is minus one

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.930
over B0 minus A0.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.840
And so you plug, now,
this in here.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.250
And instead of having this
complicated denominator, you

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.560
have a sum of two integrals
that you know how to do.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.690
Because they're basically
of the form one over x.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.410
And in doing this, you also
realize that you have to be

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.870
careful because when A0 is equal
to B0, when you have the

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.930
same amount of A and B,
then things blow up

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.770
and you're in trouble.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.980
So that's going to be
a special case.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.790
So always look out for special
cases for these things.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:23.450
So you assume, then, that B0
is not the same as A0.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.800
And then you can go forward
with solving it.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.510
So you integrate, and at the
end of the process, I'm not

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.620
going to go through it, it's
really complicated, you get

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.520
something that looks
like this.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:46.420
A0 minus B0 log of A B0 over
A0 B. And you have your

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:46.980
equation here.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.660
Now, we don't really have a good
way to plot it against

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.350
one variable.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.970
And the usual thing is look
at specific cases.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.340
And limiting cases.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.160
And there's one limiting case
we already brought up.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.340
Which is when you started with
the same amount of material.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.650
What does it look like if you
have the same amount of

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.830
material to begin with?

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:11.200
So if you have A0 equal to B0,
you start out with the same

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.680
amount of stuff, but if you
start out with the same amount

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.310
of stuff, then this doesn't
look so different from, at

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.260
least mathematically, from
this one right here.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.570
If you start out with A0 is
equal to B0, and for every

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.345
mole of A that you use up you
use a mole of B, then

00:11:27.345 --> 00:11:30.560
throughout the whole reaction,
the concentration of A and the

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.480
concentration of B are
going to be the same.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.010
So for the whole reaction, if
you started with this, A is

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.290
equal to B for all times.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.000
That makes it easy.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.030
Because now you can go back and
instead of writing A times

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.320
B, you can write A times A,
which is A squared, which is

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:47.890
what we had here.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.870
And then you have the
whole thing solved.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:57.150
So in that case here you just
have minus dA/dt is equal to k

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:06.610
A squared, and one over A is
equal to kt plus one over A0.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.430
You don't even have to do any
math, you just look at it.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.790
So that's one case.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.340
Another case is if one of the
reactants is in much higher

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.380
concentration than the
other reactant.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.180
And that's called flooding.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.960
You basically flood the system
with one reactant.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.670
And that's something that we'll
use again, hopefully by

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.710
the end of class today.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.740
Let's say that we take, so this
is another limiting case.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.860
Let's say we take A0 to be
much bigger than B0.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.010
So we flood the system
with A0.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:45.550
As a result, the concentration
of A doesn't change

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.470
very much in my pot.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.260
It's hugely concentrated
in A, there's a

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.190
little bit of B around.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.150
Again, with the process.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.600
If I use all of the B up, the
difference in A is going to be

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.850
very small.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.840
So at the end of the process,
I'm basically still going to

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.240
have A0 left in the pot.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.230
So during the whole process,
during the whole time period,

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:13.280
I might as well assume that
A is equal to A0.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.650
And that makes my life
much easier.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.850
Because now if I write my
differential equation in terms

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:24.950
of B instead of A, so the rate
of destruction of B, k A times

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:30.160
B, instead of writing A here,
it's pretty much constant for

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.730
the whole time.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.310
I'm just going to write A0.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.650
So now, if k times A0 is a
constant, and this looks

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.160
awfully like a first
order reaction.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.430
So I can solve for it.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.800
And I get that, so I can just
write the answer because I've

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.590
done this already.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.940
I don't have to do it again.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:56.760
The concentration of B then goes
like B0 e to the minus k

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.080
prime t, that's the first
order reaction.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.670
Where k prime here is this new
rate constant, this new

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:10.860
number, which is k, times A0.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.260
So that's easy to solve also.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.910
So always go to the limiting
cases, because

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.150
they tend to easy.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:25.120
And if you were to go to the
full solution and put in this

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.220
limiting case, then you'd find
that you get the right answer

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.840
this way as well.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.890
You can directly go to the easy
way of doing it, or you

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.170
can go through the whole process
of solving it and

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.140
putting the approximation
in there.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.530
And do the cancellations
and get this.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.710
But this is much easier.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.590
Just writing the answer down
is always much easier.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.540
So it's a pseudo first
order reaction.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.320
We call this a pseudo first
order reaction.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.460
So we're done with the
simple stuff now.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:04.960
Any questions on first order
and second order reactions?

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.990
So the next step is, you've
got a reaction.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.130
It could be a gas phase
reaction, it could be a

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.080
solution phase reaction.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.000
There's some quantity, some
property, of the solution

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.760
that's going to change.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.000
That's going to allow
you to follow it as

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.420
a function of time.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.920
And that property could
be many things.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.730
It could be spectroscopic.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.770
It could be that there's an
absorption in the visible that

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.980
changes as the concentration
of one of

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.760
your reactants changes.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.210
Or one of the products could
have an absorption band that

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.600
you could follow in time.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.640
Or you could using infrared
spectroscopy to

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.090
follow it in time.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.360
Or if you have a reaction in
the gas phase, and you have

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.730
more products or less products
than the reactants, and the

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.224
pressure is going to change
in time if you

00:15:48.224 --> 00:15:49.730
have a finite volume.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.840
So there's usually some quantity
that you can use to

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:59.150
follow the reaction in time
to extract out data.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:03.140
And then from that data, that
you want to know what are the

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.790
kinetics of this reaction.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.790
Because eventually
you're going to

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.770
try to find a mechanism.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.440
You're going to try to find a
mechanism that's consistent

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.520
with the data.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.780
So you get data.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:18.980
Then you want extract out of the
rate constants and orders.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.790
So let's assume that you've
found a way to get data.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.270
And now you've got to
analyze your data.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:30.980
And suppose that you've found a
way to measure the reactant

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.150
concentration as a
function of time.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:38.210
And let's say that in the first
case, the simplest case

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:43.100
is that you have one reactant.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:50.140
So you have one reactant, A.
So A goes to products.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.540
And you've managed to extract
A as a function of time.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.670
Well, the obvious thing to do
is to plot A versus time and

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.670
see what it fits like.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.520
So you take A versus time,
and you plot it.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.620
And you know that if you plot
log A versus time and it's a

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.515
straight line, well,
that's going to be

00:17:10.515 --> 00:17:12.730
a first order process.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.320
Plot log A versus time in a
straight line, you know that's

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.290
going to be first order.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.040
If it doesn't go to a straight
line you know

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.100
it's not first order.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:26.810
So then you go ahead and plot
one over A versus time.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:32.630
And if it's a straight line,
you know it's second order.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.230
And if it's not second order,
it's not a straight line.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.140
It's not a straight line, you
look for some other order.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.590
So that's one way to do it.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:44.060
And you've got to have enough
points on your graph, because

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.780
if I were to plot a, let's say
this is my data point, if I

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.700
have a second order process, at
the beginning it's going to

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.570
look an awful lot like a
first order process.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.460
It's not until after
a while that it's

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.130
going to start to deviate.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.460
So you've got to have enough
points down in time to make

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.810
sure that you can differentiate
between a

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.300
straight line and a line
that's not straight.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:15.170
And usually, that's often
a mistake that

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.330
experimentalists make.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.500
They look at the beginning.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.050
They say, oh, it's a straight
line, work is done.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.730
Go home.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:30.930
But usually you need to have a
good amount of the reactant

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.180
consumed before you can tell the
difference between first

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.700
and second order.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.000
So you'll have an opportunity
to do this on the homework.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.470
This kind of exercise of
extracting the order of a

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.340
simple reaction.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.520
Another way to do it if you have
a simple reaction is to

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.340
look at half-lives.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:19:00.230
That would be the half-life
method.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.700
If you can measure A as a
function of time, then you

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.060
know when you've gotten
A over two.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:13.500
So, you know that if I look at
the half-life versus the

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.870
concentration, the initial
concentration, of my reactant,

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.370
that tells me something
about the order.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.720
Because we saw that for our
first order, t 1/2 was

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:30.530
independent of the initial
concentration.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.640
And that for a second order, t
1/2 was proportional to one

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.620
over the inverse of the
initial concentration.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:44.580
So if you plot t 1/2 versus A0,
or have a few A0 versus t

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.640
1/2s, then you can tell the
difference between first order

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.770
and a second order reaction,
and see which one fits.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:59.710
Sometimes to get even more solid
numbers, because from

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.450
here you can also extract k.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.670
If you have a bunch of points,
of t 1/2 versus A0, you can

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.470
extract k, the rate constant.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.040
Not just the order,
but also the rate

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.040
constant out of this data.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.650
You can use multiple lifetimes
if you have enough data.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:15.910
Multiple lifetimes.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:21.540
So you can define, you
can define a t 3/4.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.470
Which is the amount of time it
takes for the concentration of

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:30.800
A to be 1/4 of what you
started out with.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.400
So 3/4 is gone.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.010
And then you can put that into
your first order rate law.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:46.530
So when you have log of A over
A0 is equal to minus kt, you

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:51.765
get that t 3/4, we can solve
for t 3/4, and you get that

00:20:51.765 --> 00:20:57.670
that's equal to two
log two, over k.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:58.970
And then you can do the
same thing for a

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.440
second order process.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.390
So this is first order.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.190
You plug in t 3/4 and A is equal
to 1/4 A0, and you solve

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:16.240
for t 3/4 for a second
order process.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:21.880
And you get that this is equal
to three over A0 times k.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:27.030
So it's the same functional
form as these two.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.960
But there's a pre-factor
that's different here.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.420
So here there's a two
that comes in there.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.500
And here there's there's a three
that comes in there.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.910
And so there's an obvious way to
tell, then, if you have the

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:39.630
t 1/2 and the t 3/4 signs.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.640
Basically, you follow, instead
of having many reactions,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.130
instead of having many
reactions to do, with

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.050
different A0's here you
can do one reaction.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.450
If you do one reaction and you
watch the reactant go away,

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.670
and you time it.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.430
When 1/2 of it is gone, that's
one time, then you keep going,

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.060
like 3/4 is gone, that's
another time.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.210
Then you can take the ratio
of those two times.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:10.800
Of t 3/4 versus t 1/2.
t 3/4 versus t 1/2.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.050
And if it's a first order
process, the ratio

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:19.090
here is just two.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:24.840
And if you take t 3/4 over t
1/2 and it's a second order

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:32.990
process, the ratio is three.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:38.010
So with one experiment, then,
you can extract out the order.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.990
You can't extract out,
well, you can extract

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.630
out the rate constant.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.150
If you know the order then you
know which equation fits, and

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.230
you can extract out the
the rate constant,

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.980
with a big error bar.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.590
You're always better off doing
many multiple lifetimes of

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:55.540
different A0's or many of
these just to get more

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.470
statistics in the result.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.780
So this is the simple process.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.640
And you always try, if you have
something complicated,

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.920
you always try to bring it
back to a one component

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.580
process by doing something
like flooding.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:14.470
So if you have five different
reactants, if you make four of

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:19.290
them in very large quantities
and keep one of them in very

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.170
small quantities, then all the
four that are in large

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.140
quantities are basically
constant over the process.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.410
And you basically are
looking at only one

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.090
reactant going away.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.270
And then you can use these
methods to figure out what the

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:39.070
order is for that
one reactant.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:45.890
So, questions about simple one
reactant sort of processes.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.250
It's pretty straightforward.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:24:02.480
So now, let's say we have more
complicated reactions.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.210
There are two ways that
we can deal with that.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.360
The first, I already mentioned,
which is the

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.850
flooding which we'll
get back to.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:13.880
And another way is called,
so we have

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.110
some complicated reactions.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.400
Complex reactions, with multiple
reactants, that's A

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.100
plus B plus C goes
to products.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:24.600
And there could be some

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.270
stoichiometry in front of there.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.970
So one of the ways to deal
with that is called the

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.160
initial rate method.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.630
We want to find out orders
and rate constants.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:46.630
Initial rate method.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:53.270
So if I look at minus dA/dt,
one of the reactants or the

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:57.300
rate of the reaction near
time t equals zero.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.310
That's the initial rate.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.820
Right as the reaction starts.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.450
I mix everything together and
I, just as after I mix it

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.640
together, I watch the process
of A disappearing or B

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.530
disappearing or C
disappearing.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:13.260
And so in reality what I'm doing
is minus delta A / delta

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:18.090
t near t equals zero, where
delta t is a small interval.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.910
So there's not much change in
delta A. Experimentally

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:21.460
that's what I do.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.410
And that's pretty much,
essentially getting this

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.550
number out.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.590
And we're going to call
that the initial rate.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:32.990
And the initial rate is k, and
at the beginning I haven't

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.790
used up anything.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.200
So all the initial
concentrations are there A0 to

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.280
the alpha, B0 to the beta,
C0 to the gamma.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.480
Et cetera if you have
more reactants.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.310
So you measure this.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:55.320
You measure this R0, and then
you repeat the same process

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.880
with a new concentration of one
of those three reactants.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.690
So with A0 prime, let's say.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:09.260
And then you get a
new R0, R0 prime.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:14.340
Then you take the ratios of
these R0 and R0 primes, R0

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.640
divided by R0 prime.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:24.640
So R0 is k A0 to the alpha, B0
to the beta, C0 to the gamma,

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.990
then you have k A0 prime
to the alpha.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:34.210
B0 to the beta, C0
to the gamma,

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:40.240
and the k's you disappear.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.250
The B0's disappear.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.150
The C0's disappear.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.210
The only thing that we've
changed is the concentration

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.450
of A0 to begin with.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.230
So the ratios of these initial
rates is the ratios of the

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:56.310
A0's to the alpha power, to
the order in terms of A0.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.330
So if you're clever about your
choice of ratios, then you can

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.690
get alpha pretty easily.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:16.280
So if you choose, so if you
now choose A0 prime to be

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:27.770
equal to 1/2 A0, then you
measure R0 over R0 prime.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:35.560
And if you get one, then you
know that that alpha's zero.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.250
Alpha has to be zero here.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.610
Then you know alpha is zero,
that gives you the order.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.100
It's a zero order reaction.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.740
If you get that R0 over R0 prime
is square root of two,

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:51.460
or rather 1/2, then a square
root of two, square root of 2,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.950
then you know that
alpha is 1/2.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.490
And that's a half order.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.060
We haven't seen any half order
reactions yet, but we will.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:04.320
Those are indicative of a
complicated mechanisms.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.940
But that's what you would get
out of this experiment.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:15.230
If you get that it's equal to
two, if you get that this

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.880
ratio is equal to two, then you
know that alpha is equal

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.500
to one, et cetera.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.880
So it's a pretty easy way
to get the order.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.410
Then you repeat the
experiment.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:30.535
Now instead of changing A0,
you keep A0 constant

00:28:30.535 --> 00:28:31.600
and you change B0.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:38.710
Or, you can use flooding or
isolation, which is the next

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.760
process to get the
other orders.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.400
And eventually you get
the rate constant.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.720
Once you have all the orders,
and you have R0, then you have

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.070
the rate constant.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.540
OK, so that's one
way of doing it.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.260
And a second way of
doing it is the

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.360
way we already mentioned.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.500
To solve the second order
reaction in two components.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.300
Which is to flood the
reaction with

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.110
everything except for one.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:14.430
So this is called flooding
or isolation.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:20.920
Basically, you isolate one
reactant and watch it.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.460
You're trying to get
back to a system,

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.840
which is a simple system.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.990
Which is a system
of one reaction.

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:31.090
So let's say you take A0 to be
much smaller than all the

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:31.910
other species.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:35.150
You flood with B and C,
and you isolate A0.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:41.510
And then your rate minus
dA/dt, it's going

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.250
to be A to the alpha.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:47.840
And instead of B, well, during
that process B's going to say

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.030
pretty much constant.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.110
Because it's hugely concentrated
in B. You can

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.930
replace B with B0.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.810
You can replace C with C0.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.720
So now you have an effective
constant, an effective rate

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:06.890
constant, and then you have a
process which is effectively,

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.820
or pseudo, one reactant.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.380
Then you can use these methods
here, you can plot A versus

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.410
time, you can find path lines,
et cetera, to gather

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.440
the order for it.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:28.240
Then you can get alpha
and k prime.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.100
And if you can change
B0 and C0, then you

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.220
get k out of this.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.340
So this is basically all fairly
straightforward, just

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:42.440
tedious experimentation to get
all these numbers out.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.240
OK, any questions on this?

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.080
You'll get experience
on the homework.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.470
There's likely to be a question
on the final where

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.680
you're given data and
asked to extract out

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:59.030
orders and rate constants.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.730
So let's move on now.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:07.260
So, so far we've looked at
first and second order

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.480
elementary processes, and we've
looked at taking data

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.390
and extracting out rate
and rate constant.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:19.370
And the next step is to
build mechanisms.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:31.300
So a mechanism is when you take
a complicated reaction,

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:37.820
like A plus B plus C goes to D
plus E. And you break it up

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.050
into elementary steps.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.060
What's an elementary step?

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.400
An elementary step
is a step which

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.440
happens in a single reaction.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:51.690
So I could hypothesize that
this complicated reaction

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:55.590
happens in three steps, where I
need to have a molecule of A

00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:00.220
and a molecule of B collide with
each other to first form

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.630
an intermediate F. Then I want
a molecule of F plus a

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.850
molecule of B to collide to
form intermediate G plus a

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:12.250
product D. Then have the
intermediate G plus reactant C

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:17.390
collide together to form the
product E. So this set of

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.020
elementary steps, where at each
step you have a collision

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:25.390
of two or three molecules
together, three is not so

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.520
common but two is very common,
those elementary steps are

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.660
called the steps of
the mechanisms.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:44.440
And these elementary steps you
can define something called

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:53.130
molecularity, which is the
number of species that you

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:56.460
need to collide with each
other in one of these

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.510
elementary steps.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.210
So the molecularity here would
be two, you need two

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.160
molecules to react.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.240
Here it's two, here it's two.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.200
If I have an elementary step
which is a zero order in one

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.490
reactant, then the molecularity
would be one.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.690
Or I could have A plus A, the
same molecules have to collide

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.400
with each other.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.330
Molecularity would be two.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.800
And the molecularity and
the order of the

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.600
reaction are connected.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.790
So if you have something which
is a molecularity of one, then

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.730
it's going to be a first
order reaction.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:29.570
One reactant is just sitting by
itself, falls apart, like

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.350
in radioactive decay.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.270
Molecularity of one, that's
a first order of process.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.510
If I need to have two molecules
come together, then

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.790
it's a second order process.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.900
If I have to have three
molecules collide at the same

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.520
time together, molecularity of
three, then it's going to

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:49.650
depend on the concentration of
all three at the same time.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.600
That's called a ternary
reaction, and those are really

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.140
quite rare.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.300
Termolecular reactions,
you need to have your

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:01.820
concentrations very, very high
to statistically get an event

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:07.370
happening where all three
molecules collide together.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:12.750
So three body reaction is hard
and anything higher than three

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.050
body is essentially
impossible.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:19.880
So that limits your choices,
which is nice.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.940
So that's the mechanism.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.700
And so what we're going to do
next is go through some

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:24.200
mechanisms.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.730
Some simple mechanisms and
build up the complexity.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:33.910
Any questions about
mechanisms here?

00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:37.430
What we're doing here is, we're
formulating a framework.

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:39.715
Where we can go back and look
at things that are more

00:34:39.715 --> 00:34:42.530
complicated, like chain
reactions or explosions or

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:47.680
enzymatic reactions, and know
when to apply approximations

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.530
and et cetera.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.750
So we basically, here,
are just laying

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:58.210
down the ground rules.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:03.820
So let's go to our first example
of a mechanism, a more

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.320
complicated reaction.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.050
And what we're going to do is
we're going to extract out

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:12.340
integrated rate laws out of
all these mechanisms.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.710
And see what it looks like,
as a function of time.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:20.610
So the first one we're
going to do is

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:22.340
called parallel reactions.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.280
Simple mechanism.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:31.030
In this case here I have one
reactant, and that reactant

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:34.040
has a choice.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.030
You can think of it as a
radioactive decay, an atom

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:41.050
decaying in two different
channels.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:44.670
So it can decay into B, or it
can decay into C. There are

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:50.470
two rate constants, k1 and k2.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:54.360
So you can write it like this,
or you can write it as A goes

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.740
to B plus C. This is how you
would write a reaction.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.290
And this is how you would
write your mechanism.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:10.090
A goes to B and A goes to C.
Each elementary step, these

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:12.550
are the elementary steps and
this is the complex reaction,

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.440
each elementary step
is unimolecular.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.480
It's a first order process.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.890
So in all of these examples, the
first thing you do is you

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:24.330
write your rate law.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.190
The rate at which A gets
created or destroyed.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:31.240
And there are two paths.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.310
It gets destroyed and into
B, with a rate which is

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:37.540
proportional to the
concentration of A, and it

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:43.040
gets destroyed into C,
proportional to the

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:49.670
concentration of A. So you write
down all the ways that A

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:51.100
can get destroyed.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.160
There are two ways here.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.660
Two channels.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:59.270
This one happens to be fairly
easy to solve. k1 plus k2

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:00.970
times A, and you've
seen this before.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:03.590
It's minus dA/dt as a constant
times A. That's

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.720
a first order process.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.530
So you can just write
down the answer.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:08.420
You don't need to do
any math here.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.680
You recognize that we just
call this one k prime.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:15.010
And that the rate is A as
a function of time.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:22.185
This is A0 e to the minus
k1 plus k2 times t.

00:37:22.185 --> 00:37:24.520
And everything you've learned
about plotting first order

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.370
processes et cetera, is
applicable here, where the

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:32.920
rate constant is the
sum of these two.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.580
So that's for the reactant.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.730
The products are also
interesting to plot as a

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.260
function of time, to see how
they are related to each other

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.650
in terms of their
concentrations.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:52.400
So let me go through
this also.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.420
When things get more complicated
we'll quickly go

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.110
and make approximations.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:59.380
But for now, we can still
do everything exactly.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:04.960
So you write down your rate law
for the product. dB/dt is

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:14.270
equal to k1 A. dC/dt is equal
to k2 times A. The formation

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:17.420
of B depends linearly on A.
The formation of C depends

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:21.050
linearly on A, because they're
both first order processes.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:25.800
To make B and C. And
you integrate.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:31.180
You integrate here from
zero to B, dB.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:38.430
Is equal from zero
to t, A dt, k1.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:39.650
A is a function of time.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.570
And we've already
solved for that.

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:43.700
It's this exponential
up there.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:51.370
So you plug in here A of time.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:53.430
And you turn the crank and you
integrate, and it's an

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.990
exponential.

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:56.020
So it's not so hard
to integrate.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.280
And you get that B is a function
of time is k1 times

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:10.480
A0 over k1 plus k2 times one
minus e to the minus k1 plus

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.680
k2 times the time.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.730
Things are already starting
to get a little bit more

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.190
messy in the math.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.700
And then to get C, you actually

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.470
don't need to do anything.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.280
Because you notice that the only
difference between B and

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.670
C here is replacing
k2 with k1.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.360
So don't worry about
doing any math.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:34.100
Just write down the answer. k2
A0, you interchange k1 and k2

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.890
at every step.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:42.000
One minus e to the minus k1
plus k2 times the time.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.480
The only difference is up
here in the k2 term.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.090
And those are your equations
for k1 and k2.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:53.610
And what you find, is the ratio
of B to C is a constant.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.980
If I divide B by C, everything
cancels out except for the k1

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.690
and the k2 here.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:02.960
Is equal to k1 over k2.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:11.280
And that is called the
branching ratio.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.390
The branching ratio, because
there are two branches out of

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.210
the reactions.

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:18.900
And this gives you the ratio of
which one is more likely to

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.030
happen than the other one.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:22.510
And so if k1 is much
bigger than k2, the

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:25.400
rate is per unit time.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:30.420
The units of k1 are per second
or per minute or per hour.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.730
So if this is big, if k1 is big,
then mostly you're going

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:38.830
from A to B, and only a little
bit of C is formed.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.830
And the ratio of B and
C is always constant.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:47.500
And so you can plot, then,
you can plot the result.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:57.900
You can sketch out the result.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:03.520
So you know that A is going to
come down exponentially.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.250
Time on this axis here,
concentrations

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:10.010
on this axis here.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.080
So this is A as a function
of time.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.510
That's that equation up here,
in exponential decay.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:21.490
And the quantity of A. And B and
C are going to come up in

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:27.120
time, also, with this
exponential format here.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.370
B is going to saturate at this
ratio right here, k1 A0

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:31.650
divided by k1 plus k2.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:35.560
C is going to saturate at
this quantity here.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.070
So they're going to start
both at zero.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:52.410
And B is eventually going to go
to k1 A0 over k1, plus k2.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:42:08.550
And C, eventually, will go
to k2 A0 over k1 plus k2.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:14.140
And this, and the ratio of these
two lines at every point

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:22.760
is k1 over k2.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.960
So, a simple question, for
instance, that you might be of

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:32.520
the type that you might be asked
to look at is, suppose

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:39.220
that k1 is 1/10 of k2.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.630
Which would you expect?

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:48.340
Would you expect to
have, let's see.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.610
So C is in green here.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:43:05.810
C, B. Or do you expect,
so A comes down.

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:10.030
B comes up.

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:17.280
C comes up like this, or do you
expect the last choice,

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:39.380
I'm going to put the last choice
here, so this is, let's

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.710
call this choice number one.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.450
Choice number two.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:49.240
Choice number three.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:54.670
So k1, the rate k1 is
1/10 of the rate k2.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:57.560
That tells you something about
the branching ratio.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.960
So do you expect this one here
to be the right one?

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.880
How many people think this
is the right one?

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.870
What about this one here?

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.350
How many people think this
is the right one?

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.130
One person.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:13.500
What about this one here?

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.760
So the branching ratio is
the ratio of the two.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.750
It's 1/10.

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:20.670
So this is approximately, in
my sketch, poor sketch,

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:22.350
granted, but this is
approximately 10

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.840
times bigger than this.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.550
So that's the ratio
that you'd expect.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:31.490
And it's the right, here k1 is
the rate into B. It's slower

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:38.420
than the rate into C. So,
you got it right.

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.120
So for more complicated, we
have a more complicated

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.740
process, we're going to ask you
the same sort of stuff.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:48.070
And it won't be as
straightforward.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:52.140
Any questions on this
beginning here?

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:59.370
Next time we're going to finish
with the parallel first

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.120
and second order processes.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.280
And hopefully we'll get done
with the complex reactions and

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:10.740
mechanisms and move
on to, I forgot

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:11.740
what's next on the list.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:17.150
But some explosions or
chain reactions.
