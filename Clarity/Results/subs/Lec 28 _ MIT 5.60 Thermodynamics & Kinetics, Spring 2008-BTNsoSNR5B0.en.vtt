00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.070
PROFESSOR: Last few lectures,
and we started to see some of

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.250
the consequences and looked
at simple changes,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.460
transformations of expansion
and mixtures

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.020
of liquids and gases.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.470
And saw how in the framework of
statistical mechanics, we

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.310
could derive the thermodynamic
results that you saw before,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.820
based on an empirical
framework.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.400
On the thermodynamic framework
we've been

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.740
working with all term.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.940
But you saw them derived from
a microscopic perspective.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.060
Now what I want to do is move
to examples that are more

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.000
commonly encountered
in chemistry.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.860
One that we did last time
actually was very common, or

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.070
is at least a prototype
for something common.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.275
That is we looked at what would
be a simple model for a

00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:03.980
polymer with different
configurations

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.310
available to it.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.550
And just tried to understand
what the basic thermodynamics

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.240
is that it would exhibit.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.590
What the heat capacities would
be in various limiting cases.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.320
High and low temperature.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.180
I want to continue that today.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.090
But for an even more
common case.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.480
So the model that I want to lay
out is indicated on your

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.540
notes for today.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.440
And essentially, you
could look at it as

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.370
double stranded DNA.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.850
Any kind of polymer with
a whole variety of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.950
configurations.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.150
Ultimately what's going to
matter is what is the set of

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.170
energy levels available
to the system.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.480
And so here's what
it looks like.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.700
The way I've tried
to depict it.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:57.420
I'm imagining something like,
covalently bonded chains that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.690
have links between them.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.250
So of course, it's reminiscent
of DNA with hydrogen bonding

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.770
between the strands.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.910
And the idea in this simple
model is that you can have

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.110
various numbers of these
hydrogen bonds.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.890
So this is the case that
would be the most

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.980
energetically stable.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.010
That is, all the available
hydrogen bonds are formed

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.930
between neighboring pairs.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.570
So this would be our
lowest energy.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.890
Now let's starts breaking
some hydrogen bonds.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.020
And what I'm imagining is they
break starting at one end and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.110
working their way down.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:52.370
So the next highest energy
state would be like this.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.610
So now these are still
hydrogen bonded.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.980
This is not.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.040
And there's a cost in
energy for breaking

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.140
that hydrogen bond.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.910
We'll call it epsilon zero.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.340
It's a positive number.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.100
So that this is higher
energy than this.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.500
And now we'll go to the next
one, which could have two

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.440
broken bonds.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:26.980
Broken hydrogen bonds.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.580
And so on.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.990
And if we imagine that this is
very long, there may be many

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.320
many, members of the chain.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.030
Then of course this sequence
of structures with

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.360
corresponding energies might
go on for a very long way.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.500
So this is a simple construction
that gives us a

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.670
set of states with distinct
energies.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:56.340
And so we have a series of
configurational energy levels.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.990
They're evenly spaced
in this model.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:09.780
So there's zero, E
zero, two E zero.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.530
And so on.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.630
So those are available
energy states.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.920
And now, just based on that
simple model, we should be

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.570
able to figure out all
the thermodynamics.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.620
We should should be able
to figure out what the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.710
equilibrium energy is at a
particular temperature.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.230
What the average energy is.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.330
And so forth.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.150
And we can do it in a
straightforward way.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:47.440
So we'll start with our
molecular partition

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.230
function, as always.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.920
So it's q configurational.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.300
And it's just a sum over our
available states with their

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.240
associated Boltzmann factors.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.170
So sum over n of e to the
minus En over kT.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.110
Now the way I've modeled this,
there are no degeneracies.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.660
Each energy level has just one
microscopic state of the

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.280
molecule corresponding to it.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.240
So there are no molecular
degeneracies.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.840
Turns out we'll be able to put
this into a simple form.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.110
So the first thing is, let's
approximate that we could take

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.920
the sum -- not to some finite
level, which would be the case

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.900
if there's a finite number
of elements in the chain.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:48.660
But all the way through
infinity.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.560
And the idea here is
the following.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.160
We'll assume that the
chain at least has

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.140
a great many members.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.590
Even if it's finite.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.140
And then at some point, this
becomes a really small number.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.840
Even if epsilon naught, the
energy of one of the bonds, is

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.650
less than kT.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.530
Once we multiply it by a very
large number n, it becomes

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.320
very much greater than kT.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.200
So the underlying assumption
here is, well there will not

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.600
be a significant number of
molecules in the highest

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.790
energy state anyway.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.150
In other words, the terms higher
than a finite but large

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.200
value of n between there and
infinity are going to be so

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.585
small that those terms will
contribute negligibly to the

00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:40.990
sum anyway.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.280
And on that basis, we could
make this approximation.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.730
And the incentive to make this
approximation and carry the

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.860
sum to infinity is that then we
can put this in what turns

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.060
out to be a very simple
closed form.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.280
So now if we just write out a
few of the individual terms in

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.450
the sum, it's one plus
e to the minus

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.330
epsilon zero over kT.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.240
Plus e to the minus epsilon
zero over kT.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.520
I'll write this as squared.
e to the minus two

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.670
epsilon zero over k t.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.830
And so on.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.330
So this has the form of a sum
that looks like one plus x,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.970
plus x squared, and so on.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.450
And because the sum goes to
infinity, we can simply write

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.630
it as one over one minus x.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.590
Sort of a very simple result.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:38.550
And now putting this back into
x, it's one over one minus e

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.290
to the minus epsilon
zero over kT.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.450
That's our q zero.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:51.140
Our molecular partition
function.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.860
So this model yields a
particularly simple

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.740
result for q zero.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.360
And then everything else
follows from there.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:12.430
So then we can write the
canonical partition function

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.420
capital Qn.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:21.100
It's just q configurational to
the capital Nth power, where

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.690
capital N is the total number
of these molecules.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.640
So it's just one over one minus
e to the minus epsilon

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.930
over kT to the Nth power.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.190
And then we can start writing
out the results for the

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.940
various thermodynamic
properties.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:54.140
So A configurational is minus
NkT, log q configurational.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:03.150
That is, remember, A is minus kT
log capital Q. And this is

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.410
just going to come
straight out.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:10.850
So it's minus NkT
log of little q.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:17.240
Minus NkT, log of one over
one minus e to the minus

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.950
epsilon over kT.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:26.880
Or positive NkT, log of one
minus e to the minus

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.140
epsilon over kT.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.010
So a pretty simple form for
the Helmholtz free energy.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.790
And I'm not going to write out
all of the individuals

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.510
thermodynamic terms, but I'll
write a few of them.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:46.485
So mu, the chemical potential
for these configurations, is

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:47.735
just dA/dN.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.190
With T and V constant.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.030
And so the only capital
N dependence, the only

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.490
dependence on the number of
molecules is multiplicative.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.320
Right here.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.750
So this just gives us kT log
of one minus e to the minus

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.820
epsilon naught over kT.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.980
And the important point to
realize here that we mentioned

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.830
last time too, in the examples
we considered then, especially

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:21.750
the last one, is that because
the only place that N figures

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:26.050
in is as a multiplicative
factor.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.490
What this is telling us is that
we just have a chemical

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.180
potential, of Helmholtz free
energy per molecule.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.910
The molecules are
all independent.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.140
The total energy doesn't depend
on any interaction

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.530
between this molecule and its
neighbor somewhere else.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.750
So terms like this are
simply additive.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.420
So if we work out the chemical
potential, it's just one over

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:56.120
N times A.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:04.410
And I'll just write the result
for u configurational.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.040
Because I do want to look
at the heat capacity.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:22.670
So it's Nk T squared, d log of
little q configurational / dT.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.590
With N and V held constant.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:31.310
And it turns out to just
be N epsilon zero.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:40.770
One over E zero over
kT minus one.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.930
So now we can look at
the heat capacity.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:49.030
Cv configurational.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:54.590
So it's du configurational
/ dT.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:59.420
With constant N and V. And
taking this derivative with

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.600
respect to temperature.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.160
Gives us an expression of
the following form.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:16.920
It's Nk epsilon zero over k T
squared. e to the E zero over

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:24.460
kT, over e to the E zero over
kT minus one squared.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.480
Just taking the derivative
in the usual way.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.530
Now, this looks kind
of complicated

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.360
for the heat capacity.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.330
But let's take a look, just like
we did last time for the

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.130
simpler case that we treated
then, let's take a look at the

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.800
high and low temperature limits
of what happens to the

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.010
heat capacity.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:59.740
So at high temperature, well we
can start by just looking

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.100
at the energy.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.570
That has a form that's
fairly simple.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.790
So when temperature is large,
this is small, and we can

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.950
Taylor expand it.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.130
So then we're just going to
have one plus epsilon zero

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.010
over kT minus one.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.160
Which means the ones
will cancel.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.450
And we end up with a fairly
simple result.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:24.830
So u configurational, in
that case, is just NkT.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.580
The epsilon zeroes are
going to cancel also.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.200
And what that says is that the
heat capacity -- and of course

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.720
we could take the limit of this,
but we can just take the

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.090
derivative of this
with respect to

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.850
temperature more easily.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.230
So Cv configurational.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.340
It's just N times k.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.450
In other words, the heat
capacity in the high

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.480
temperature limit
is a constant.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.430
Last time we treated a simpler
case, where there were only

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:01.930
four configurations altogether
available, to this sort of

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.490
simple polymer model
that we drew.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.330
Unlike this present model where
we're saying there are

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.510
essentially infinite number of
configurations and different

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.240
energies available.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.420
So many that the highest ones
we're never even going to

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.420
access, because they'll be
much higher than kT.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.760
Here it's different,
so now we have --

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.620
You know before, when we had
a limited number of total

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.980
states, remember what happened
in the heat capacity at high

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.420
temperature.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.910
What was the limiting case?

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.920
Finite number of states.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.710
What's the heat capacity
at high temperature?

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.180
This is going to
be on the exam.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.750
What's the heat capacity at high
temperature, if there's a

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.540
finite number of states
available?

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.660
STUDENT: Zero.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.310
PROFESSOR: It's zero.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:57.550
What was the low temperature
limit of the heat capacity?

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.670
STUDENT: Zero.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.700
PROFESSOR: It was also zero.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.180
Right.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:05.980
And the idea was for
a system with a

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.510
finite number of states.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.010
The idea was -- so let's say,
the way we had it before,

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.970
there was one state
with energy zero.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.290
And we had three states with
some energy epsilon zero.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.840
And that was it.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.500
Those were all the molecular
states available.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.960
So we looked at the two cases.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.130
In one case, when the high
temperature limit where kT is

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.640
much bigger than any
of this stuff.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.990
In that limit, the molecules are
just equally likely to be

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.560
in any of these states.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.260
Because there's much, much more
thermal energy than this

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.130
energy difference.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.860
And the molecules are constantly
getting kicked

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.960
around by the available
thermal energy.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.940
So if you raise the temperature
a little bit more,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.320
it doesn't make any
difference.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.800
The molecules already
are evenly

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.260
distributed among the states.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.080
There's no additional
configurational energy.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.480
So du/dT is zero.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.640
It can't increase any more.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.090
So in that case, the high
temperature limiting heat

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.950
capacity is zero.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:19.240
And in the other case --

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.640
In the low temperature
limit, now let's say

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.640
kT is really low.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.700
It's much less than
epsilon zero.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.900
So now we'll redraw
this as zero.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:36.940
And put the epsilon zero
states up here.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.740
And kT is here.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.710
Well when it's like this, the
temperature is so low that

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.240
there's not nearly enough
thermal energy to populate any

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.420
of these states.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.320
And if you change the
temperature by a little bit,

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.700
it's still not enough thermal
energy to populate any of

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.740
these states.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.400
So once again, du/dT is zero.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.980
You change the temperature and
the configurational energy

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.230
doesn't change.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.810
So the heat capacity
is zero again.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.360
This is why it's so informative
to measure heat

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.110
capacities.

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:10.040
Because you can learn an awful
lot about the intrinsic

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.000
structure of the material.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.260
What are the energy levels
available to it?

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.890
What do they do?

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.930
You can learn a tremendous
amount about that by making

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.960
measurements of the
heat capacity.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.690
Well, now we're in
a different case.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:30.350
We have a whole set of evenly
spaced energy levels.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.550
Never ends.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.680
So now let's look at the
high temperature limit.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.170
But we're never in a limit
that's higher than the highest

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.430
level, because we're assuming
it goes on forever.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.420
So it's up here somewhere.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.400
There's kT.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.320
So what happens?

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.220
Well if you raise the
temperature, there still are

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.970
higher lying levels that can
be populated, and that will

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.190
get populated.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.210
So du/dT isn't going to be zero
in the high temperature

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.550
limit, in this case.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:04.660
But it stops changing
at some point.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.060
Because nothing's very different
about this than

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:12.480
having kT be, let's say,
up here or up here.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.580
So in the high temperature
limit, yes, the energy does

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.920
change with temperature.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.270
But it changes in the same
way at any temperature.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.950
In other words, the energy is
just linearly varying with

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:26.320
temperature.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.910
And the heat capacity is a
constant. du/dT doesn't change

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.880
anymore, once you're in the
high temperature limit.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.760
Now without me writing any
expression on the board,

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.510
what's the low temperature limit
of the heat capacity

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:45.240
going to be in this case?

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.480
Going to be on the exam.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.490
STUDENT: Zero?

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.690
PROFESSOR: Zero, that's still
going to be the same, right?

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.650
Put kT way down here.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.780
That's just like this, right?

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.340
Not near enough energy to
populate even though lowest,

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.320
you know, the first level
above the ground state.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.800
Change the temperature a little
bit, still not enough

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.690
thermal energy to
get up there.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.020
So the energy doesn't change
with temperature in that low

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.790
temperature limit.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.790
So you can immediately see
what's going to happen at low

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:33.440
temperature.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.020
Any questions?

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.230
Yeah?

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:42.902
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
will still be n k t, and

00:19:42.902 --> 00:19:43.320
then it's just --

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:43.760
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.425
PROFESSOR: So, of
course, that's a

00:19:45.425 --> 00:19:48.300
limiting case here, right?

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.640
That happened because in the
limit of high temperature,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.000
then this exponent is
really small, right?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.770
So then you can Taylor
expand it.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.120
In the limit of low
temperature,

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.310
this is really big.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.770
This is nearly zero.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:09.050
So e epsilon zero is much bigger
than kT in that case.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.170
This is big.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.070
This is negligible, right?

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.370
Oh.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:19.470
Wait a minute.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:24.800
Something's making
me real unhappy.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:42.890
I can't have this right.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:43.790
Ah.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.160
Yes.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.480
It needs to be zero, is
what it needs to be.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.110
What am I thinking?

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.430
Of course.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.560
It's one over a huge number.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.310
It's zero.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.480
OK.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.260
So of course you can't
expanded it.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.000
It's just, this is much
bigger than this.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.830
This is an enormous number
at that point.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.220
So in other words, what it's
saying is the configurational

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.720
energy is zero, because
everything is stuck in the

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.660
ground state.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.960
And it stays zero if you
vary the temperature.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.860
So you get the zero limiting
value for the heat capacity,

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.910
and the energy itself
is also zero.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.490
Other questions?

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:32.930
OK.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:37.030
Let me just make a few comments
about the entropy.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:42.120
So I didn't write
it out before.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:47.040
And I'm tempted not to
do it again, but I

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:57.260
suppose I'll do it.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:02.320
So it turns out to be Nk, minus
log of one minus e to

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.710
the minus epsilon
zero over kT.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.570
Plus epsilon zero over kT.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:19.930
Over e to the epsilon zero
over kT, minus one.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:24.320
And this comes from combining
the terms for A and u.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:36.840
It comes from minus A over T.
Plus u over T. And what I want

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.040
to do is look at its limiting
cases also.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.120
In particular, what happens
here in the limit of high

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:58.560
temperature.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:07.620
And what happens turns out to be
k log kT over epsilon zero

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.450
to the Nth power.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:16.010
Or put the N over here.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.910
OK.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:24.210
And what this is telling us
about is the number of

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.360
available states.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.140
Roughly, how many states are
there that are accessible to

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.860
the system at some
temperature.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.470
So in other words, think of it
as -- let's put the N back

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.270
there. k log of kT over epsilon
zero to the Nth power.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.260
And think of it as k
log capital omega.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.880
Where that would be
the degeneracy.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.810
Now all the states are in equal
energy, but remember for

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:57.070
the whole system, remember
we discussed this before.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.960
How you have a very, very narrow
distribution of system

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.360
energy states at equilibrium.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.460
So you can think of this as the
degeneracy of the system

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.230
states that are actually going
to exist at a particular

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:16.090
temperature.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:28.670
So if we look at the limiting
value of the partition

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:34.780
function, it's just
kT over omega.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:44.660
Or the same thing for
capital Q. kT over

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.110
epsilon zero, sorry.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.750
To the Nth power.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.140
So you have a very simple
expression.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.500
And so again, what this is
doing, is it's giving us a

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.350
measure of about how many
states are available.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.290
And it's particularly
informative to look at that

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.180
for the molecular partition
function.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:13.110
What it's telling us is, if
I look at kT over epsilon.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:15.160
And these levels, remember,
are evenly spaced.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.730
So here's epsilon zero, two
epsilon zero, three epsilon

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.730
zero, and so on.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:28.060
It says, you know, if kT is
about ten times bigger than

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.780
epsilon zero.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.460
So this is ten.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.760
It's telling us, roughly how
many states does the system

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.840
have thermal access to.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.170
The molecular state.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:45.320
It has about ten states.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.920
So going over to our picture of
the set of structures, you

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.630
could have anywhere up to
about ten bonds broken.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:59.520
Now, the individual molecules
are going to be in a whole

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.480
range of states.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.450
Some of them will have fewer
than that, and some of them

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.690
will have more than that
number of bonds broken.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:12.040
But on average, it's going
to be about that number.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.870
And then, if you look at the
whole system, the number of

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.510
states available, of course
it's astronomical.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.995
Because you have to take each
molecule, and say, well it

00:26:23.995 --> 00:26:26.540
could be in any one of
something on the

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.080
order of ten states.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.060
And then whole set of N other
molecules can be in the states

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.400
they might be in.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.790
Change the first one,
and do it again.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:40.540
So you have this astronomical
number of system states.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.840
But remember, like we discussed
once before, it'll

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.000
turn out that although the
individual molecule states

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.800
vary considerably with energy,
the system states, which are

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.350
averaging over some astronomical
number of

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.150
molecules, where capital
N is something

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.460
like ten to the 24th.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:06.490
Once you average over that many
individual molecules, you

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.540
find that there's very,
very little

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.110
fluctuation in the energy.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.000
In the system energy.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.050
The individual molecule energies
vary considerably.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:21.370
Realistically the variation of
the molecular energies -- that

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.200
variation is going
to be comparable

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.210
to the energy itself.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.260
To the average energy.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.690
So if the average energy is
roughly you know, the ten

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.550
epsilon zero, you say okay,
how much might it vary?

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.550
Well, there are going to be some
molecules that have only

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.240
a couple of bonds broken,
and some that might

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.070
have 20 bonds broken.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.120
The variation will be on the
same order of magnitude as the

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.550
average itself.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:49.450
But then you average over
capital N of them.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.840
And then you immediately
discover that there's very,

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.960
very, very little variation.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:03.870
And in particular, what happens
then, is, you know,

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:14.970
for molecular average energy,
epsilon zero, and variance, or

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:22.950
standard deviation about
the same magnitude.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:29.830
System average energy is
u, and it's going to

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.940
be capital N times.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.490
Well let's say that
-- average --

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.350
Oh sorry, let me not
put the zero There.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.650
It's just average energy.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.620
And the system average energy
is just N times

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.820
the molecular energy.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:56.180
But the system variance is going
to be on the order of

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:02.300
the square root of
N times epsilon.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.990
If you've done statistics,
then you've seen

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.050
that sort of result.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:09.740
You do a bunch of samplings a
capital N number of samplings,

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.180
and the variation looks
like the square

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.140
root of that number.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.240
So what ends up happening
then, if you look at the

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.900
relative variation, you might
look and then say, well it's

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.440
pretty big.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.720
This is ten to the 12, right?

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.860
It's still a huge variance.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:47.140
But let's compare it
to the average.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.150
So this is ten to the 24th.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.160
This is ten to the 12th.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.820
It's on the order of ten
to the minus 12.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.840
An incredibly tiny fractional
variation

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.930
in the system energy.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:01.940
You could never --

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.540
There would be no practical
way to measure it.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.800
And of course that is
consistent with

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.550
what you would expect.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:12.150
If you say let's measure the
configurational energy of a

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.090
bunch of molecules in a liquid
solution, or molecules in a

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.320
gas floating around.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.960
And it's a mole of them, that
total average energy is not

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.160
going to fluctuate
significantly, even though

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.570
individual molecules that you
pick out of that whole system

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.700
might have quite widely
varying energies.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.250
And that's the point.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.740
So it's an incredibly
small variation.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.500
Now you can derive this.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.870
I didn't derive this,
of course.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.080
I asserted that this
is the case.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.540
And it's probably familiar to
some of you if you've seen

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.270
some statistics.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.710
But the way you would derive it
is, you know in addition to

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.700
calculating the average energy,
the average of E, you

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.340
can also calculate the average
of the energy squared.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.980
And you can calculate the
standard deviation that way.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.590
You calculate the average
of E squared.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.670
And then you minus the average
of E, the quantity squared.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:06.390
Take the square root.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.180
That's your root mean square.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:13.040
And that's what leads
to this result.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.400
So it's pretty straight forward
to calculate it also.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:17.910
Alright.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.230
So any questions about just the
extent of variation of the

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:27.370
individual molecule energies
or the system energies?

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:28.330
Okay.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:42.250
Then, now what I'd like to do
is look at another kind of

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:46.450
energy that's going to turn out
to have exactly the same

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.650
set of levels that
we just derived

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.480
from this simple model.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.670
And some of you may have
seen this before.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.010
Many of you may not have.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.350
And for right now, I'll
just assert it.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.360
But it will illustrate why
this is so useful.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:06.270
It turns out that if I've got
molecular vibrations -- you

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.310
know, there's nitrogen and
oxygen in the air.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.640
If I look at those nitrogen
vibrational energy levels.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.930
Or oxygen energy levels.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.280
They look like this.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:23.220
Evenly spaced, non degenerate
energy levels.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.730
So the model that we've
constructed here, based on

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:34.230
this simple two-chain polymer,
actually gives us a set of

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:38.180
energy levels that maps directly
onto the vibrational

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.700
energy levels of a molecule.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:50.890
So all the results that we've
just seen apply, not just for

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:57.410
conformations of a
polymer, but for

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.220
vibrations of a molecule.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:04.200
So everywhere where it says
configurational, you can just

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.900
write in vibrational.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.040
And you'll still be right.
because of course, what

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.000
matters is what are the states
that are available to the

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.130
system, and what are
their energies?

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.880
After that, the formalism of
statistical mechanics takes

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.140
over, and calculates partition
functions and

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.610
thermodynamic functions.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:28.380
The input into that is states.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.880
And their energies.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:36.200
Well, we have the exact same
set of states and energies.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:41.630
So we immediately arrive at a
super important case and its

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:46.030
results for molecular
vibrations.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:51.590
And not only molecular
vibrations, but vibrations of

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:57.000
a crystal lattice.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.440
Acoustic vibrations
of a glass.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.380
Or even a liquid.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:07.140
So there's an enormously wide
ranging set of results that

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:13.020
we've derived by starting
at this simple picture.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.670
And when you take quantum
mechanics, you'll see that

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:19.250
indeed you do get this set of
evenly spaced energy levels.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:21.530
You may well have seen the
results before, and you'll see

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.100
it derived there.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.180
OK.

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:31.050
Given that, then I want to
talk a little bit further

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:33.620
about the heat capacity.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:39.360
So we've seen the limiting cases
for the heat capacity.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.380
Namely, the low temperature
limit is zero.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.150
That's the case whenever you
have quantized levels.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:49.340
You can always get kT lower
by far than the

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.060
lowest excited state.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.550
So that everything is stuck
in the ground state.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.770
How low that is depends
on how far apart

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:57.720
the states are spaced.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.350
But there's got to be some
temperature somewhere that's

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.490
down there.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:16.310
So we've seen the heat capacity
limiting cases.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:36.670
Let me just sort of
draw them again.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:41.200
So here's kT much less
than epsilon zero.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.750
And up here, kT is much bigger
than epsilon zero.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.510
Now I'm just going to sketch
the full temperature

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.990
dependence.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:53.130
In other words, I'm going to
connect those two limits that

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:56.130
we've seen.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:14.990
So here's what that
looks like.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:20.600
And I'll write it
as vibrational.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.200
So we know it's got to be zero
at the low temperature limit.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:30.390
And we know that it's this
constant value in the high

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.550
temperature limit.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:33.110
It's Nk.

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:40.790
And in some way, it
smoothly connects.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.470
And if you look at the actual
scale, here -- so here's kT

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.340
over epsilon zero.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.920
Here's the limit of
low temperature.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.910
Actually, you don't have to be
very high above epsilon zero

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.430
to be in in this high
temperature limit.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:37:00.360
So if you look at the plot
that's on your notes, this is

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.790
already -- it's not quite
leveling off precisely.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.940
But it's already pretty close.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:10.290
When kT is just two times
epsilon zero.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:22.300
It's already almost at
the limiting case.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.960
Now this has tremendous
significance.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:30.230
So a long time before quantum
mechanics was developed,

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.760
people made measurements
of the heat

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.450
capacities of materials.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.830
And they were familiar with the
fact that when you got to

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.580
ordinary temperature -- room
temperature, the heat capacity

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.960
was temperature independent.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.500
And that was understandable
for reasons

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.990
we'll discuss shortly.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:55.150
Basically, in that case, the
heat capacity -- it's not just

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:58.720
Nk for one vibrational mode.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.600
Of course, that's what I
describe for a single

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.710
vibrational mode of,
say, a molecule.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.120
If you have a crystal lattice
with N atoms in it.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.440
Let's say it's an
atomic crystal.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.610
Each atom has three degrees
of freedom.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:14.550
It can move in each of three
independent directions.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.930
And there are N of
those atoms.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.080
There are 3N total degrees
of freedom.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.570
That's how many vibrations
the lattice has.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:29.070
So in fact, you have to
multiply this by 3N.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:34.580
So what would be seen is,
you'd have 3R, the gas

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.680
constant, per mole,
in other words.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:44.550
And if you looked at Cv
over 3R, then this

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:50.160
value would be one.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.290
Very useful to see that.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.250
To figure that out.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.970
And people understood it.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:03.190
What people didn't understand
is this stuff.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.740
Why did it do that?

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.830
That was a great mystery.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:13.110
Why did the heat capacity go
to zero at low temperature?

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:15.870
And the reason they didn't
understand it is because the

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.980
model for vibration
was really simple.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.960
The lattice is a bunch of
masses and springs.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.060
I know the vibrational energy.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.810
And I can calculate it.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:31.890
That is, I know the classical
vibrational energy.

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:35.880
Remember, the reason it
goes to zero is this.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.150
It's all because of the fact
that the energy levels are

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:43.460
discrete, quantized levels,
with gaps in between them.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:47.730
If I've got classical mechanics,
then that means

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:48.850
it's vibrational energy.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.770
The energy just gets bigger if
the amplitude get bigger.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.420
It's not discrete,
it's continuous.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.690
There are always energies
in there.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:59.790
In that case, there's never
a situation like this.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:03.600
Where kT is lower than the first
available excited level,

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.650
and everything's in
the ground state.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.830
That never happens in classical
mechanics, because

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.390
there are always levels there.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:13.250
But it does happen in
quantum mechanics.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:17.910
And Einstein recognized that
this was a way to explain this

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:20.800
low temperature limiting
heat capacity.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.200
So actually if you look at early
development of quantum

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.990
mechanics, really it
was all predicated

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.780
on statistical mechanics.

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.790
And the idea that, well, that
you could then do the

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:35.400
statistical mechanics with
quantized levels, just the way

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.260
we've done it.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.070
And what you immediately
discover is, gee,

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.330
it all makes sense.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.100
You go to low temperature,
everything's stunk down here.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.160
And suddenly you've got zero
heat capacity, because you

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.890
changed the temperature a little
bit, and everything is

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:51.680
still stuck back here.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.800
So that's the vibrational heat
capacity of a solid.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.890
That's what it looks like.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:01.230
And at moderate temperature,
this doesn't have to be very

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.280
much bigger than epsilon zero.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.410
You're already in, essentially,
the limit.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.520
The high temperature limit.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:12.140
And now for molecules, that
limit isn't usually reached at

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.640
room temperature.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:20.570
Here's a kind of calibration.
kT at room temperature is

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:27.480
about equal to 200
wave numbers.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:32.020
So molecular vibrations, you
know, you've taken IR spectra

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.190
they're typically on the order
of 1,000 wave numbers or so.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:40.540
kT isn't bigger than the
vibrational energy.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.330
But a crystal lattice, you know
the vibrations are the

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.560
acoustics vibrations.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.770
And those are much lower
in frequency.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.590
If you have an atomic crystal,
it just has the sound

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.750
vibrations at all the different

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.830
wavelengths that are available.

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.890
They're never very high.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.890
So it's easy to get into
the high temperature

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:04.700
limit, in that case.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.660
Where you basically
see a temperature

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:14.720
independent heat capacity.

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720
OK.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.440
By the way, this was actually
used commonly to determine the

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.860
molecular weights of
molecular crystals.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:25.060
Because you've got a factor of
the number of moles in there.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.670
If you ask how big is
the heat capacity?

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.270
Well it does depend on
how many moles of

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.590
material you have.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.360
Because it depends on
how many atoms.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.130
That control how many modes
there are in the crystal.

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:35.510
How many vibrational modes.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.050
Because each atom has 3N
degrees of freedom.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.830
So if you just weigh the whole
crystal, and then you measure

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.390
the heat capacity, you know how
many moles there are, and

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:45.830
now you know the weight,
you can figure out

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:49.660
the molecular weight.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:53.150
OK.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:54.860
So that's the low temperature
limit.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.670
And now I want to talk a little
bit further about the

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.670
high temperature limit.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:04.510
And in particular, I want to
talk about both the heat

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.510
capacity and the energy
that we've seen.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:11.060
Namely, this thing.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.070
Of course it's really the same
result for the energy and the

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:14.900
heat capacity.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.720
They're obviously intimately
connected.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.340
So these are the high
temperature limits.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:32.470
Now it turns out that that high
temperature limit doesn't

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:35.150
just obtain for vibrations.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:39.270
But it's also the case for
molecular rotations,

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:41.680
translations.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.860
All these low energy
degrees of freedom.

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.050
So let's see why.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.880
It has a name, that result.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:59.980
It's called the equipartition
of energy.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:06.760
Sometimes it's called the
classical equipartition of

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.970
energy theorem.

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:22.460
And what it says is one half
kT per degree of freedom

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:31.040
equals energy in the
high T limit.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:38.440
And in particular, for
translation, so E

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:44.390
translational is 3/2.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:49.900
Well, NkT for N atoms.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:55.250
Or molecules.

00:44:55.250 --> 00:45:00.890
E rotational is, now it depends
how many rotational

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.770
degrees of freedom there are.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.170
If I've got a linear molecule,
there are only two.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:08.320
It can rotate this way, and
it can rotate this way.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.140
If I've got a non linear
molecule, parts all over the

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.410
place, it has three
unique axes.

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:15.890
It can also spin this way.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:17.880
And that's a rotational
degree of freedom.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.510
Of course the linear molecule
wasn't like that.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:23.340
Nothing is moving when
you do that.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:30.050
So it's either NkT, linear.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:34.120
Or 3/2 NkT.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:34.770
Non linear.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:38.560
Great.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:49.500
And then E vibrational is NkT
per vibrational mode.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.420
That's because vibrational
energy is potential and

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:56.390
kinetic energy, and
it's 1/2 kT each.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:59.510
Why does all that
stuff happen?

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:10.040
Turns out, you can see
why pretty easily.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.580
All those degrees of freedom.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:20.710
Those classical degrees
of freedom.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:31.400
If you say, let's write out an
expression for the energy.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.910
Classical.

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:39.760
You know it's 1/2 m v squared.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.590
Or it's 1/2 k x squared.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:51.080
Or for rotational energy it's
1/2 I omega squared.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.850
You see a functional
form emerging here?

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:56.380
That looks similar in
all these cases?

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.070
You know, 1/2 times some
constant, times

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:03.130
some variable squared.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:11.820
Well, now let's look at our
expressions for the energy.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.260
Average energy.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:21.650
We're going to sum over all the
energies of epsilon i, e

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:25.050
to the minus Ei over kT.

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:30.420
Over sum over i, e to the
minus Ei over kT.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:34.960
That's just how we originally
derived the average of energy.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.800
In other words, it's the
probability of each state

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.340
times the energy
of that state.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:44.320
Summed up over all the states.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.560
Well, now we have an expression
for the energy.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.700
It's one of these things.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:53.670
It's something times
a variable squared.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:48:01.210
So, we'll use some general
functional form, a y squared.

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:04.670
And now, let's assume we're in
the high temperature limit.

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:06.570
And we've seen what
that means.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:11.060
It means kT is big,
compared to the

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.580
separation between the energies.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:15.450
When that's the case, there
are lots of these

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:16.580
terms in the sum.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.120
We can convert them
to integrals.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.390
We can forget about
the fact that the

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.390
energies are discrete.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:22.400
We can say look, they're
so close

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.590
together, compared to kT.

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.850
That we can turn the sums
into integrals.

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:36.680
So then we have integrals
instead of sums.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:37.600
And here's our energy.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.070
It's a y squared.

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:39.930
Whatever that is.

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.680
It could be this, it could be
this, it could be this.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.880
And it's not going to matter.
e to the minus a y squared

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:54.880
over kT over, integral over e to
the minus a y squared over

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.570
kT. dy, dy.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.650
OK.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:06.710
And here's what's
going to happen.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:09.280
If you do this integral
by parts.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.160
This one.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:16.800
What ends up happening is it
gives you this integral times

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.370
a certain number.

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:23.200
This is going to come
out of the integral.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.410
And so it will turn out.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:27.920
And it's straightforward
to do it.

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.720
It's in the notes.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.700
It goes through.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.680
But I'll just write
the result here.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.850
The result is that you get, in
this high temperature limit

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:42.370
where you've gone to the
integral form, you get 1/2 kT.

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:43.790
And it will always
be the case.

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:47.530
All you need to know is the
form of the energy.

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.260
As long as that's the case --

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.920
Remember y is just a variable
of integration here.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.460
That's not going to
be preserved.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:00.070
This comes out because
of what happens here.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:03.520
So what that's telling you is
whenever you have an energy of

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:07.320
this form, and you're in the
high temperature limit, then

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:11.860
you get this classical

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.110
equipartition of energy result.

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.610
So, for translation, of course
there are three separate

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:17.770
degrees of freedom.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.300
For velocity in the x,
y, or z direction.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.640
For rotation, if it's a linear
molecule, let's say there are

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.740
two separate degrees
of freedom.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.660
You have to keep track of
how many degrees of

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:27.630
freedom there are.

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:29.710
But that's all you have to do.

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:31.300
That's enormously powerful.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:35.590
It means that without doing
anything, I know the average

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:39.070
translational energy of the
molecules in this room.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:40.270
Because of course I'm certainly
in the high

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.170
temperature limit.

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:43.820
With respect to translational
energy levels, they're really

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.370
closely spaced.

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:48.250
Same with rotations.

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:51.210
Now at room temperature
vibrations, forget it.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.950
I have essentially no
vibrational energy.

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:57.460
I'm at the low temperature
limit for the molecular

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.500
vibrations of nitrogen
or oxygen.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.700
Those are high in frequency.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.570
So much higher than
200 wavenumbers.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.990
But for each molecule,
I have 3/2 kT of

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.680
translational energy.

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.650
Linear molecules, I have kT
of rotational energy.

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:14.890
Without doing any work at all.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:18.400
And since that applies to most
molecules at room temperature,

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.390
it's an incredibly useful, very,
very general result.

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.860
OK.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:26.320
Next time we'll do a little bit
of chemistry, and look at

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.910
phase transformations.
