00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.660
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: Last time you
talked about the first law

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.350
of thermodynamics.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.410
And you talked about isothermal
expansion, the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.010
Joule expansion.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.370
You saw a very important result.
which is that for an

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:48.350
ideal gas, the energy content
is only dependent on the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.610
temperature, nothing else.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.770
Not the volume, not the
pressure, it just cares about

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.400
the temperature.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.340
So, if you have an isothermal
process for an ideal gas, the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.270
energy doesn't change. q plus
w is equal to zero for any

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.220
isothermal process.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.020
And you also saw that du then
could be written as Cv dT for

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.160
an ideal gas always.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.670
This is not generally true.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.450
If you have a real gas and you
write du is Cv dT, and your

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.960
path is not a constant
volume path, then you

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.860
are making a mistake.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.040
But for an ideal gas, you
can always write this.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.670
And this turns out to be very
useful to remember.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.640
OK, now most processes that we
deal with are not constant

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.070
volume processes.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.880
So energy, which has this
wonderful property here, du is

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.240
Cv dt for constant volume
process, which happens to be

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.550
equal to d q, constant volume,
because there's no change.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.680
there's no work if you've got
a constant volume process.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.980
So du here is a very interesting
quantity, because

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.140
it's related to the heat that's
going in or out of the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.620
system under constant
volume process.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.270
But as I said, we're not
operating usually in a

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.910
constant volume environment.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.680
When I flail my arms around
I generate work and heat.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.040
This is not a constant
volume process.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.550
If I'm the system, what's
constant when I do this?

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.590
Anybody have an idea?

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.760
What's the one function
of state?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.250
I'm the system, the rest
are the surrounding.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.470
What's the one function of state
that's constant when I'm

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.330
doing all my chemical
reactions to

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.670
move my arms around?

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.190
Temperature?

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.490
STUDENT: Pressure?

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.520
PROFESSOR BAWENDI:
Pressure, right.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.350
Pressure is constant.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.920
What is the pressure at?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.440
One atmosphere, one bar.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.860
So the most interesting
processes are the processes

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.090
where pressure is constant.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.160
When I had have a vial on bench
top, and I do a chemical

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.860
reaction in the vial, and it's
open to the atmosphere, the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.930
pressure is constant
at one atmosphere.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.610
When you've got your cells
growing in your petri dish,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.170
the pressure is constant at
one atmosphere, even if

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.610
they're evolving gas, pressure
is constant.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.160
So we'd really like to be able
to find some sort of equation

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
of state, or some sort of
rather function of state

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.980
that's going to relate the heat
going in or out of the

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.360
system with that function of
state, because this isn't

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.670
going to do it. du only relates
to the heat under

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.450
constant volume.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.640
And the heat is a really
important thing to know.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.250
How much heat do you need to put
into a system, or how much

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.590
heat is going to come out of
a system when something is

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.700
happening in the system?

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.740
All right, this is a really
important quantity to know.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.470
Your boiling water or whatever,
you want to know how

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.100
much heat do you need to boil
that amount of water under

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.700
constant pressure?

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.190
And this is where enthalpy
comes in.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.930
You've all heard of enthalpy.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.060
H we're going to write it as
the function of temperature

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.140
and pressure.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.360
And the reason enthalpy was
invented was exactly for that

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.180
reason, because we need some
way to figure out how to

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.890
relate the heat coming in or
out of a system under a

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.850
constant pressure process.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.740
Because it's so important.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.370
And I should add and also under
reversible work, where

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.170
the external pressure is equal
to the internal pressure.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:11.110
OK, so we're going to define
enthalpy as u + pV, these are

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.620
all functions of state here, So
H is a function of state,

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.320
and we're going to see now how
this is, indeed, related to

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.170
the heat flow in and
out of the system.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.760
If you have a constant
pressure,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.960
reversible work process.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.460
Let's take a system.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:34.100
Under constant pressure T1, V1,
going to a second -- this

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.910
is the system, so let me
write the system here.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:46.750
And it's more dramatic if the
system is a gas, p, T2, V2,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.720
And let's look at what happens
to these functions of state,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.700
to H to u under this
transformation.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.660
OK, so let's look at delta u.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.490
Delta u is q plus w.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.870
That's the first law.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.100
And this is a constant pressure
path, so now I can

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.460
write, this q is actually q
under constant pressure.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.620
Little p means the path is
a constant pressure path.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:26.450
And I'm doing reversible work.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.520
So that w is minus p, dV where
p is the pressure inside the

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:39.750
system, minus p delta V.
Rearrange that, delta u is

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.990
plus p delta V is
equal to q p.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.530
All right, so this is the heat
flowing in or out of the

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.500
system, and these are all
functions of state.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.640
This depends on the path.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.700
It tells you right here, the
path is constant pressure.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.080
These don't depend on
the path, right.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.570
V doesn't care how you
get there. u doesn't

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.370
care how you get there.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.500
In this case, p is a constant
because the path is constant.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.780
So we can bring the p
inside, delta u plus

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.550
delta p V it's q p.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.820
Take this delta outside again,
delta of u plus p V

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.090
is equal to q p.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.750
And there you have it.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.040
There is the H right there.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:36.750
The u plus p V. Delta
H is equal to q V.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.600
And this is the reason why
enthalpy was invented, and why

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.610
it's so important.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.230
Because we want to know this.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.500
So this for a finite change.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.590
If you want to have an
infinitestimally small change,

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:55.900
you end up writing
dh is dq sub p.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.580
It's not always equal
to the heat.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.770
It's only equal to the heat if
your process is constant

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:06.260
pressure reversible work.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.510
OK, so this is the kind of, this
is the kind of concept

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:18.010
that needs to be branded into
your brain, so that if I come

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.800
into your bedroom in the middle
of the night and I

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.020
whisper to you delta H, you
know, you should wake up and

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.180
say q p, right?

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.270
Heat under constant pressure
reversible work.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:34.440
This should become
second nature.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.760
This is where the intuition
comes from.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.380
This is why people
right tables and

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.720
tables of delta H's.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.826
Why you have delta H's from all
these reactions, because

00:08:44.826 --> 00:08:47.120
this is basically the heat, and
the heat is something we

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.130
can measure, we can control.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.180
We can figure out how
much heat is going

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.360
in and out of something.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:58.880
This is what we're
interested in.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.150
OK, so last time you
looked at -- any

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.070
questions on this first?

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.710
Yes.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:11.640
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] from the T
delta V to the delta p here?

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.710
What was the reasoning
behind that?

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:13.405
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: p
is constant here.

00:09:13.405 --> 00:09:17.710
It's constant pressure.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.750
OK, so now, last time you looked
at the Joule expansion

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:28.020
to teach you how to relate
derivatives like du/dV.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:34.610
du/dV under constant
temperature. du/dT under

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:35.700
constant volume.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:42.620
You use the Joule expansion
to find these quantities.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.140
Now these quantities were
useful because you could

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.830
relate them.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.100
The slope of changes, with
respect to volume or

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.910
temperature of the energy with
respect to quantities that you

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.710
understood, that you
could measure.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.200
We're going to do the
same thing here.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.910
So if we take as our natural
variables for enthalpy to be

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.450
temperature and pressure, and we
have some sort of change in

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.790
enthalpy, dH, and it's going
to be related to changes in

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.800
temperature and pressure through
the derivatives dH

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.270
through the slope of the
enthalpy in the T direction,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:23.340
keeping pressure constant, dT
plus the slope of enthalpy in

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.390
the pressure direction, keeping
the temperature

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:31.890
constant, dp, and these are
knobs that we can turn.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.050
We can change of temperature.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.510
We can change the pressure.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.830
These are physical knobs that
are available to us as

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:38.650
experimentalists.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.500
And so when we turn these knobs
on our system, we want

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.760
to know how the enthalpy is
changing for that system.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.010
Because eventually they will
tell us maybe things about how

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.130
heat is changing further on.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:57.380
OK, but in order to relate
turning these physical knob to

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.450
this quantity here, which we
don't have a very good feel

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.080
for, we've got to have a
feel for the slopes.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.260
If I keep the pressure
constant.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.640
I change the temperature,
what does that mean?

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.090
What is dh/dT?

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.300
If I keep the temperature
constant, and just change the

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.535
pressure, dH is going
to change, but how

00:11:14.535 --> 00:11:15.310
is it going to change?

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.070
What does this mean in terms of
something I can physically

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.140
understand?

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.740
That's the program now for
the next few minutes.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.500
What are these quantities?

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.870
What is dH/dT as a function,
keeping pressure constant,

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:35.930
what is dH/dp, keeping
temperature constant?

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:42.670
All right, let's start with the
first one, dH/dT, keeping

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.780
the pressure constant.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:53.170
And we're going to look at a
reversible process to help us

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.330
out, but the result is going to
be independent of whether

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.960
or not we have a reversible
process or

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.570
irreversible process.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.870
Constant pressure, that means
dp is equal to zero.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.490
So for reversible process,
constant

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:11.560
pressure, what do we know?

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.130
This is already branded
in your brain, right?

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.650
Reversible process, constant
pressure dH=dq.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:27.770
So we can write that down,
dH=dq, constant pressure.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.060
That's by definition
of enthalpy.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.190
That's why we created
enthalpy.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:30.870
What else do we know?

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.880
Well we can go look up here,
looking at the differential,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.050
there are no approximations
here.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.870
This is just an equality.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.360
I have a constant pressure
process.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.250
This term here is
equal to zero.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:51.330
That means that dH is also
equal to dH/dT, constant

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.100
pressure dT.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.680
All right, so now I've got
more dH/dT under constant

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:05.190
pressure. dH is equal to this,
and it's also equal to this.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.540
All right, these two are
equal to each other.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:13.530
Now, I know how to relate the
heat flow to temperature

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:19.710
change, through the heat
capacity. dq constant pressure

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.780
is that heat capacity, and I
have to tell you the path for

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.610
the heat capacity.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.010
So it's C sub p, the heat
capacity under a constant

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.290
pressure path, dT, all right?

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.580
So these two are equal
to each other.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:40.320
So, these two are equal to
each other as well, which

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:49.520
tells me that this derivative,
dH/dT constant pressure is Cp.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.960
So now I have my first of my
two slopes, in terms of

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.450
something that's related to my
system, the heat capacity of

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:58.880
the system.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.050
Something I can measure and I
can tabulate, and when I turn

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.920
my dT knob here I know
what's going to

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.710
happen to the enthalpy.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:15.600
So this is the first,
this is the one.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.660
So it's very similar to what we
saw with the volume and the

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.640
energy, where du/dV under
constant temperature was equal

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:31.280
to Cv in this case here, right.
and you're going to

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.980
find that there's a lot of these
analogies between energy

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.790
and enthalpy.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.890
You just change volume to
pressure and basically you're

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.880
looking at enthalpy under a
constant -- anything that's

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.010
done at a constant volume path
with energy, there's the same

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.590
thing happening under constant
pressure path for enthalpy.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.110
So you can guess the answer
usually that way.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.240
OK, so now we have the other
one, dH/dp constant

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.850
temperature.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.170
How do we relate this to
something physical?

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.120
Well, it's going to be an
experiment, very much like the

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.250
Joule experiment.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.090
The Joule experiment
was a constant

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.750
energy experiment, right.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.630
Here we're going to have to
find a constant enthalpy

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.010
experiment, and that is going
to be the Joule-Thomson

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.650
experiment.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.530
That's going to extract out
a physical meaning to this

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:20.850
derivative here.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:26.810
OK, the Joule-Thomson
experiment.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:40.380
This is going to get us dH/dp
constant temperature.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.380
What is this experiment?

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:50.940
You take a throttle valve, which
consists of some sort of

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:58.800
porous plug between two
cylinders that is insulated.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.600
There is insulation here.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.030
Insulation on the bottom.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:08.190
It's like a, think about a tube,
a large tube, insulated

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:14.250
tube, with a bunch of -- a
frit inside here, which

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.490
prevents flow of gas, which
slows down the flow of gas

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.240
from one side to the other.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.190
It's a blockage in
this tube here.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:30.340
Then you put two pistons, one on
that side here, and one on

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.800
this side here, and the external
pressure here, we're

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.080
going to call that p1.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.920
The external pressure here,
we're going to call that p2,

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.540
and we're going to do it
slowly enough that the

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:53.830
pressure on this side of the
cylinder is in equilibrium

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.500
with the external pressure, and
the pressure on this side

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.630
of the cylinder is in

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.370
equilibrium with this pressure.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.690
But not so slowly that these
two are in equilibrium with

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.100
each other.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.200
So this is restricting
the flow, so there's

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.910
some sweet spot here.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.460
When I'm pushing slowly enough
here that the pressure here is

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.030
equal to that one, but not so
slowly that the air flow from

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:26.310
here to here is fast, compared
to how fast I'm pushing.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.150
You got the picture here?

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.820
Any questions on that?

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.040
All right, then as I push
through, I'm going to start

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.790
with all of my gas on this
side, and at the end, I'm

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:41.500
going to have all the gas
on the other side.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.420
Let me first ask you this, is
this a reversible or in

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.250
irreversible process?

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.670
Right, let me add one more piece
of data here which I

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.150
said in words, but which is
actually important to write

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.060
down before doing the problem.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.590
Is this a reverse
-- any guesses?

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.030
How many people vote for that
this is a reversible process?

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.710
I've got one vote back
there, two votes,

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.780
three votes, four votes.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.850
Anybody else?

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.990
How many people think this
is irreversible?

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.670
It's about a tie, and everybody
else doesn't now.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.110
All right, I'm going to give
you ten seconds, fifteen

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.300
seconds to make up your mind.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.070
You're not allowed to be
on the fence here.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.740
You've got to decide,
all right?

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.990
This is, you can talk to your
neighbors, you know, do a

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.710
little bit of thinking.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.730
And I'm going to give you ten
seconds to figure this out,

00:18:33.730 --> 00:19:08.800
what your vote is for that.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.230
All right, let's try again.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.520
How many people vote that
this is reversible?

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.350
That looks like a
majority to me.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.090
Irreversible?

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.100
Let's look at the
show of hands?

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.660
All right, so this is
the majority here.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.120
Good thing physics doesn't
work on the rule of the

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.630
majority, otherwise we'd
be in big trouble.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.500
Wow, let's walk through that.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:39.230
I'm sorry to say that this
is the wrong answer.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.970
OK, why is that the
wrong answer?

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.470
Well, just think, you know,
think about it.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.120
You're pushing through here.
p1 is greater than p2.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.620
What does it mean for a process
to be in equilibrium

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.620
or reversible?

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:59.780
It means at any point you can
reverse the direction of time,

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.810
and it will look fine, right.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:07.310
So now I'm pushing on this
plug here, with p1

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.960
greater than p2.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.450
I'm pushing, I'm pushing,
I'm pushing. p1 is

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.160
greater than p2.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.820
Then I want to reverse
direction of time.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.210
I want the arrow of time to go
so that the gas goes from p2

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.210
to p1. p2 is less than p1.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:25.670
Is that going to work out?

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.490
If p2, the pressure in p2, is
less than the pressure in p1,

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.630
is the gas going to want to go
from p2 to p1 and the whole

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:36.130
thing reverse back?

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.070
You've got to put more pressure
on one side than the

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.190
other if you want to push
that gas through

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.760
the throttle, right?

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.270
So this is where the time scale
issue comes into play.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:52.730
I said let's do this slowly
enough that this p1 is in

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:58.040
equilibrium with this p1, but
not so slowly that this

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.200
pressure is equivalent
to that pressure.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.790
If I do it really, really
slowly, so that everything is

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:09.396
reversible, well I won't be able
to do it, because p1 and

00:21:09.396 --> 00:21:11.470
p2 are different.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:17.250
But suppose that I fix my
pistons here, with p1 greater

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.940
than p2, and I don't touch
it, eventually p1

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.810
will be equal to p2.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.970
I'll come to some sort
of equilibrium.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.110
So this is a system which
is out of equilibrium.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:34.040
If I stop, if I move slowly,
if I move more slowly, then

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.020
these two will want
equilibrium.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.110
So this is an irreversible
process.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:48.520
The Joule-Thomson experiment
is irreversible.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:54.570
OK, important -- if you are part
of this group here, think

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:58.670
about it and make sure
you understand that.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.250
All right, so this is
the experiment.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.820
Now what are we doing
with that?

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:11.040
The initial state, let's look
at what we are doing.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.270
So initially, we're going to
have our piston, there's the

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.220
plug sitting here.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:26.730
Our piston on the right side
here fully out, and the piston

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.100
on my right side, your left
side, fully inside.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.310
There's no gas on
that side here.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.190
So there's p2 sitting here.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.450
There is p1 sitting here, and
all of the gas is sitting on

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.520
that side of the plug.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.390
Then after we're done with the
experiment, we'll have

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:55.200
transferred all of the gas from
one side to the other. p1

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:01.900
here. p2 sitting here.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.220
And there's going to be some
volume V2 and some volume V1,

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.080
but are not necessarily
the same.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.840
Especially since the pressures
are different. we don't know

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.680
yet about temperature so I don't
know what to say about

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.708
these volumes because I don't
know what the temperatures'

00:23:17.708 --> 00:23:20.380
are going to do.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.860
OK, so let's go through this and
see what we would do which

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.660
is to calculate the
heat and the work.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:32.950
This is well insulated.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:40.470
So, what is the -- let's
do the first one here.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.710
What's q for this process here?

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.820
Anybody?

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.260
STUDENT Zero.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:47.710
PROFESSOR BAWENDI:
Zero, right.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.910
This is an adiabatic process.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:49.760
It's well insulated.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:56.030
Heat is not going in or out,
adiabatic. q is equal to zero.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.150
So all we need to find
out is the work now.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.830
Let's divide it up into the two
sides, the work going on

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.160
on the left hand side, my left
hand side or your left hand

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.390
side, and the work going on
on the right hand side.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.410
So let's first look at
the left hand side.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:15.620
OK, so w, first of all, work is
being done to the system on

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.135
the left hand side here.

00:24:17.135 --> 00:24:20.610
I'm pressing on the gas.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:24.390
So I expect that to be
a positive number.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.320
The pressure is constant, p.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.930
The V goes from V1 to zero.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.100
So we write down p1, V1.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:41.810
On the right hand side, the
work, let's call this left

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:45.720
hand side, let's call this
right hand side.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.800
Here there's an expansion going
on, so the system is

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.320
doing work to the
external world.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.130
This piston is being brought
out, so we expect the work to

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.170
be negative, negative.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.100
And we start out with
zero volume.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.010
We end up with a volume of V2,
and the external pressure is

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:05.290
constant to p2.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.510
Minus p2, V2.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:16.660
Minus p delta V. So the total
work is the work from the left

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:22.240
hand side plus the work on the
right hand side, which is p1

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:28.130
V1 minus p2 V2.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:35.930
Which I can rewrite
as minus delta pV.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.210
Delta pV is p2 V2 minus p1 V1.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:42.890
It's the pressure volume
multiplied together at the

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:48.060
final state, minus pressure
volume from the initial state,

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.500
with the minus sign
here because it's

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.030
the negative of that.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:26:03.620
All right, what is delta u?
delta u is q plus w. q is

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.090
zero. delta u is just w.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:14.780
So this is also just delta u.
delta u is minus delta pV, for

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.060
the process.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:27.520
OK, delta H is delta
of u plus pV.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.900
By definition, that's how we
define enthalpy up here.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.750
H is u plus pV.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:39.890
Delta H is delta of u plus pV,
which is equal to delta u,

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.270
plus delta pV.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.810
Now delta u is minus delta pV.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.550
So I have minus delta
pV plus delta pV.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.700
This is equal to zero.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:56.070
So this irreversible process,
this Joule-Thomson process, is

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.590
a constant enthalpy process.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:01.220
Delta h for this process
is equal to zero.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.680
Adiabatic q equal to zero.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.180
It's also delta H
which is zero.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:10.280
The two didn't necessarily
follow, because remember,

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.810
delta H is dq so p is only true
for a reversible constant

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.060
pressure process.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.120
This is an irreversible
process.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.270
So a priori, this was not
necessarily true.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.670
It turns out after you do all
the math, it turns out to be

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.250
delta H equals zero.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.060
All right, so this is
the experiment.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.260
How do we go from that
experiment to the terms that

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.220
we're trying to get,
these slopes.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.470
Remember, we're trying to get
delta H, we're trying to get

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:44.480
dH/dT constant pressure and
dH/dp constant temperature.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:52.170
OK, these are the two things
were trying to get here.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:28:08.900
OK, so let's write down,
what we know here.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.580
I'm missing something.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.410
Oh, we already know one thing.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.510
We already know this guy here.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:14.640
We already did that.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.280
OK, dH/dT constant
pressure is Cp.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.270
That was easy one.

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.280
So we already know that.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:31.190
So now we can write or
differential dH as Cp dT plus

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:36.820
dH/dp, constant temperature,
dp.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.520
Now we want to find out
what this guy is here.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.050
Now for this experiment, this
is a constant enthalpy

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.755
experiment for the Joule-Thomson
experiment, this

00:28:47.755 --> 00:28:50.930
is equal to zero.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:57.770
So I can rearrange this to get
this dH/dp in terms of things

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.560
that I can either measure, like
the heat capacity, or

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.320
that I have control of,
like dT and dp.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:11.940
So in this case, dH/dp constant
temperature is minus

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:23.265
Cp dT/dp, and this is under
constant temperature, no, not

00:29:23.265 --> 00:29:25.790
constant temperature.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:31.780
Whatever the experi -- for
that the experiment is.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:39.810
For that experiment, the
constraint, so we need a

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.280
constraint here, right, we
need a constraint here.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.080
Right?

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.620
We need a constraint here.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.910
The constraint isn't constant
temperature because the

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:48.980
temperature is going
to be changing.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.070
It's not constant pressure,
because we have a

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.190
delta p going on.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.030
It's not constant
volume either.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.620
The constraint is the constraint
of the experiment,

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.860
and the constraint of the
experiment is that the

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.420
enthalpy is constant.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.520
So the constraints
we have here, is

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.890
the constant enthalpy.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:13.290
It's the constant enthalpy
process that we're looking at.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.200
This we can do experiments on.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.090
It's tabulated in books, and
this we can measure in the

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:18.620
experiment.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:23.150
Delta p here is the change in
pressure from the left side to

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:26.010
the right side, and we can put
a thermometer, measure the

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.320
temperature before the
experiment, and measure the

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.240
temperature after
the experiment.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:38.640
So this is something
we can measure.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.830
So now we have this derivative,
in terms of

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.870
physical quantities, things
that we can measure.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.630
Things that we can relate
to the properties of the

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.730
substance that we're doing
the experiment on.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:54.810
So this is basically delta
T and delta p and the

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:59.640
Joule-Thomson experiment.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.650
And so Joule and Thomson did
these experiments, and they

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.800
measured lots of gases, and they
found that, in fact, this

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.500
was something that they
could measure.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.430
Sometimes it was positive,
sometimes it was negative, and

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.170
it was an interesting number.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:17.760
And so they defined them, after
many experiments, the

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.670
limit of this, delta T delta p
and the limit of delta p goes

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.000
to zero as the Joule-Thomson
coefficient.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:37.360
So, basically dT/dp, constant
enthalpy is equal to mu, by

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.330
definition, Joule-Thomson, where
mu Joule-Thomson is the

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.686
Joule-Thomson coefficient, just
like you saw last time

00:31:44.686 --> 00:31:49.470
eta sub j was the Joule
coefficient for dT/dV under

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.910
constant energy.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:53.620
So there's, again, total analogy
here between what

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.680
we're doing with enthalpy to
what you did last time with

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:03.300
energy, replace p with
T and H with u.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.730
Flip those two and you
get the same thing.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:11.020
OK, so now we have dH/dT is
equal to Cp, and we can also

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:19.090
write, then, dH/dp under
constant temperature is equal

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:24.700
to minus Cp mu Joule-Thomson.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:30.590
We have our two derivatives in
terms of physical quantities,

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.010
which is going to allow us,
then, whenever we have a

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:39.180
change to go back and, when we
have a change where we adjust

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.300
the temperature and the
pressure, we'll be able to

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:48.670
know what the enthalpy
change is.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.510
OK, now let's take two cases.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:58.170
Let's first start talking
about ideal gases.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:03.170
The last time you saw that for
an ideal gas, the energy only

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.800
cared about the temperature.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:11.610
It didn't care what the volume
was doing. du/dV under

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:16.240
constant temperature was equal
to zero for an ideal gas.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.360
And by analogy, we expect the
same thing to be true here,

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.210
because enthalpy and energy
have all this

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.910
analogy going on here.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.900
So let's look at an ideal gas.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:34.110
So for an ideal gas, we saw that
u was only a function of

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.420
temperature.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.970
We also have the equation
of state for an

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:38.300
ideal gas, pV = nRT.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:46.720
We can write our definition of
enthalpy, h is u plus pV.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.610
This only depends on the
temperature. pV= nRT.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:57.320
So we have u only depends
on temperature plus nRT.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.980
The only valuable now on this
side is temperature.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.320
Pressure and volume
have dropped out.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:10.220
So enthalpy, for an ideal gas,
only cares about temperature.

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.680
Pressure has dropped out of the
picture completely here.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:21.760
So there is no p dependence
here.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:26.680
H for an ideal gas is only a
function of temperature.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.290
This is not true for a real
gas, fortunately, but it's

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:32.510
true for an ideal gas.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:39.890
So for an ideal gas then,
dH/dp under constant

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:42.800
temperature, that has
to be equal to zero.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.170
Because temperature is constant
H only cares about

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.030
temperature. and that's
equal to zero.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.980
And if that's equal to zero,
that means that the

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.410
Joule-Thomson coefficient
for an ideal gas is

00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:57.440
also equal to zero.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.470
We're going to actually prove
this later in the course.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:01.800
Right now, you're taking
it for granted.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.980
Right now we told you Joule did
all these experiments and

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.020
he found out that for an ideal
gas, that the limit in and

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.260
ideal gas case was that the
eta J was equal to zero.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.590
Therefore, from experiments,
u is only a function of

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:20.140
temperature for an ideal gas,
and therefore from these

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.240
experiments, we come
out with delta H

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.870
dH/dp is equal to zero.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:30.140
The Joule-Thomson coefficient
is equal to zero.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.050
Later we are going to prove it
exactly. but right now you're

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.930
going to have to take
it for granted.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:40.470
So, if the Joule-Thomson
coefficient is equal to zero,

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:44.815
just like we wrote, du = Cv dT
for an ideal gas, we're going

00:35:44.815 --> 00:35:50.670
to have dH = Cp dT for
an ideal gas as well.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.900
dH is Cp dT.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.240
This term goes away.
dH = Cp dT.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.990
That's the only thing
that's left behind.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:59.890
So if you know the heat
capacity, you know the change

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.300
in temperature, you know
what enthalpy is doing

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.430
for an ideal gas.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:11.615
This needs to be stressed that
this is the ideal gas case.

00:36:11.615 --> 00:36:14.250
Now regular gases, real gases,
fortunately as I

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.680
said, don't obey this.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.240
This is important because we
use this all the time for

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.380
when, when we do technology.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:29.590
One example of Joule-Thomson
coefficient being not equal to

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:34.700
zero for a real gas that you've
like experienced is if

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:38.630
you take a bicycle pump, take
a bicycle pump, and you're

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:41.910
pumping up your tire, you're
working pretty hard, so you're

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:42.930
getting hot.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:48.310
But if you touch the valve going
into your tire, which

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:50.270
basically measures the
temperature of the air going

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.440
into your tire, that is
getting hot, right.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:59.490
So if you've got to pump that
tire really a lot, then you're

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:00.460
going to you're going
to really feel

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.610
a lot of heat there.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:06.420
The compression of the,
basically it's an adiabatic

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:06.940
compression.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.650
You're taking the air inside
of the pump and you're

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:11.510
compressing it.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:14.040
You're doing it so fast that
there's not enough time for

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.710
heat to come out of the gas
that's inside the pump towards

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:21.160
the walls of the pump.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.560
So your time scale it just
fast enough that this is

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.150
basically an adiabatic
compassion.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:29.290
Your compressing it really fast,
all right, so you're

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:32.160
changing the pressure.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.740
You're changing the pressure,
and the temperature is going

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:42.960
up. dT/dp is positive. dT/dp
is positive. dT/dp is

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.330
positive, well that's mu
JT. dT/dp is mu JT.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:53.610
So for a real gas like air,
this is a positive number.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:54.540
It's not zero.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.930
Air is not an ideal gas.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:38:02.080
It's one simple example of --

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:08.340
The fact that mu JT is not zero
for real gases is how we

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.680
are able to liquify things like
hydrogen and helium, by

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.660
compressing them and pushing
them through a nozzle, and the

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.760
expansion through the nozzle
cools the gas.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.540
Right, in this case here it
wouldn't happen if it

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:27.170
was an ideal gas.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:32.610
Or in many kinds of gas
refrigerators where you push a

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.790
gas through a nozzle close to
room temperature, what you

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.800
find is that the gas coming out
on the other side under

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.850
lower pressure is cooler than
the gas that went through on

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:45.240
the other side.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.170
Real refrigerators actually work
with liquids that go into

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:50.970
gases so use the latent heat of
the liquid, so it doesn't

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:55.850
really work like the
Joule-Thomson expansion.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:56.600
So this is real.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.130
This is real, unlike the Joule
coefficient which is very

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.890
small so that most gases have
tiny Joule coefficients.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:03.755
So if you do a Joule experiment,
you hardly measure

00:39:03.755 --> 00:39:04.620
a temperature change.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.850
With real gases, here you
do actually measure it.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:14.670
You can feel it with your finger
on your bicycle tire.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:19.190
OK, so we're going to see this
using a Van der Waal's gas.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:25.660
Let's look at a Van der Waal's
gas and see what happens in

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:35.340
the Van der Waal's gas.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.360
Any questions, first?

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.520
What we've been talking about,
the Joule-Thomson experiment,

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:47.530
constant enthalpy process?

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.410
OK, so let's take our
Van der Waal's gas.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:53.320
Remember the equation of state
for Van der Waal's gas is not

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:59.250
pV is equal to nRT, but p plus
the attraction term.

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:05.840
And then V minus the excluded
volume term is equal to RT.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.390
Two parameters, this is the
attraction between two atoms

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.060
or molecules in the gas phase.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.970
This is the repulsion,
not the repulsion.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:14.950
This is the fact that we occupy
a finite volume in

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:19.290
space, because they're little
hard spheres in this molecule.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:23.310
OK, in a few weeks, you're going
to find out that we can

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:28.550
calculate dH/dp from this
equation of state, and you're

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:32.290
going to find out that dH/dp
from that equation of state is

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:37.800
proportional to b
minus a over RT.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.560
This is going to be probably
a homework at

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.080
some point to do this.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.420
For now, let's take
it for granted.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:46.850
Let's take it for granted that
we know how to calculate this

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:50.060
derivative from an equation
of state like this.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:56.010
But now we're going
to use that.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:56.330
OK.

00:40:56.330 --> 00:41:02.980
So since dH/dp under constant
temperature is proportional to

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:12.120
minus mu JT, then we have that
dT/dp under constant enthalpy

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.490
than it is related to the
negative of this, a over RT

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:19.330
minus b

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:26.230
All right, this is how the
temperature changes when you

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.180
change, when you have
pressure changing.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.750
So when you do an expansion or
compression, my adiabatic

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:38.880
compression of my bicycle
pump is dT/dp.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.150
All right.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.900
Or when I do an expansion of
hydrogen or helium at low

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:52.630
temperature, through a
Joule-Thomson experiment, when

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.720
I want to liquify hydrogen
or helium.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.360
I want to cool a gas with a
Joule-Thomson experiment, what

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.770
temperature do I
have to be at?

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.910
So this tells you that you
have to be careful what

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:06.240
temperature you're at, because
depending on how high, how big

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.780
this temperature here is, you
could either be, have a

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:14.770
negative dT/dp, if this first
term is small enough, meaning

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:18.890
if temperature is very high,
then you end up with a

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:19.940
negative term.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.260
If the temperature is very
small, then one over the

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.450
temperature is large, and the
first term wins and you have a

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:27.920
positive number.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.300
So there's some special
temperature which is going to

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:34.440
depend on the gas where the
first term is going to be

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.670
equal to the second term, where
Joule-Thomson is zero,

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:42.730
or it's going to behave
like an ideal gas.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:48.470
So when that is the case,
we're going to call that

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.590
temperature the inversion
temperature or T inv.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:55.080
We call that inversion because
on one side you end up cooling

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:55.450
if you compress.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:58.450
And on the other side of that
temperature you end up heating

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:03.740
if you compress.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:08.480
OK, so there's some temperature,
t inversion minus

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.650
b where the gas behaves
like an ideal gas.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.880
The Joule-Thomson coefficient
is zero and that inversion

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.470
temperature, you can
solve for it.

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:29.480
Conversion temperature is equal
to a over R times b.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.790
OK, so when you are at that
temperature, everything looks

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.420
like an ideal gas,
as far as the

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.480
enthalpy changes are concerned.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.470
Now if you're at the temperature
which is higher

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.580
than the inversion temperature,
in that case

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:50.900
here, a over RT is small
compared to b, and this is

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.860
going to turn out
to be negative.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.260
So if you had a high
temperature, this a small

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.280
compared to b.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:06.960
If you're negative, which means
that dT/dp at constant H

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:14.770
is less than zero.

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:20.930
So that means that if you
compress something

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:21.820
it's going to cool.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:27.860
The temperature rises when the
pressure drops, right?

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:32.760
Or in this case here, if I do my
Joule experiment delta p is

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.540
negative, p2 is less than p1,
that means that delta T is

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.650
positive, right?

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.650
So in this experiment here, this
side is going to heat up.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:49.870
So for materials where T
inversion is low, lower than

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:53.870
room temperature, then you would
end up heating up in

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:54.660
this expansion.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.120
You're basically expanding the
gas from one side to the other

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.550
and the expansion causes the
temperature to rise.

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:08.310
If T is less than T inversion,
you have the opposite case,

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:13.450
and dT/dp is greater
than zero.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:17.850
So in this experiment here,
delta p is less than zero.

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.530
You need to have this whole
thing greater than zero.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.990
So delta T is less than
zero as well.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.970
So if you're below the inversion
temperature and you

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.320
do the Joule-Thomson experiment,
you're going to

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.040
end up with something that's
colder on this

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.920
side than that side.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.240
Ideal gas would be the
same temperature.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.480
But now, so this is where the
refrigeration comes in.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.700
So if you take a gas, and you're
below the inversion

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.040
temperature and you make it go
through this irreversible

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.260
process, the gas comes
out colder from that

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.930
side than that side.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:52.890
So the work that you're doing to
expand, to go through this

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:59.970
experiment, ends up
cooling the gas.

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:08.000
OK, for most gases, T inversion
is much greater than

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.280
300 degrees Kelvin.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.450
Much greater than room
temperature.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:13.600
For more most gases, if you
do this experiment at room

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.640
temperature, you end up cooling
the gas, and you can

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:21.060
cool it measurably, which is why
also, your bicycle pump,

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.680
you know, you push down,
you compress, this is

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.900
an expansion here.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.060
You're expanding from this
side to that side.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.530
Bicycle pump you are compressing
the gas, which is

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.840
the opposite, you end up heating
up the air in the

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:38.070
bicycle pump in your
compression.

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:41.733
There are two exceptions to this
rule that most gases have

00:46:41.733 --> 00:46:44.830
a T inversion which is greater
than 300 degrees Kelvin, and

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:45.720
that's hydrogen.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:52.010
The T inversion for hydrogen
turns out to be 193 degrees

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:58.810
Kelvin, and the T inversion for
helium turns out to be 53

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:04.960
degrees Kelvin.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.030
And so when, there's a lot of
liquid helium that's being

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:09.060
used on campus.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.810
We use a liquid helium.

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:14.170
And so in order to make a liquid
helium, you can't take

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.100
helium at room temperature and
do this, because if you did,

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.770
you would just heat it up,
because the room temperature

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.780
is above the inversion
temperature, so Joule-Thomson

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:23.920
would heat up the helium.

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.510
So you need first to take the
liquid helium and cool it

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:31.880
below 53 degrees Kelvin before
you can do the Joule-Thomson

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.180
to cool it even further
to make liquid helium.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.860
So you have to do
it in stages.

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.200
You take your room temperature
liquid helium, and you cool it

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.550
with liquid nitrogen to 77
degrees Kelvin, the new,

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:46.380
you're not quite there yet,
unfortunately right?

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:50.130
Then you take hydrogen you cool
it would liquid nitrogen

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:53.720
to 77, then you can use
your hydrogen gas.

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:58.260
Do a Joule-Thomson hydrogen gas
which you first cool with

00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:58.690
liquid nitrogen.

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.160
Liquid nitrogen, 77, that's
below 193, so you can do

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:05.740
Joule-Thomson on hydrogen, cool
the hydrogen to below 53,

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:09.120
then use your cold hydrogen to
cool the helium, and then you

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.340
can do the Joule-Thomson on the
helium to cool it further

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.910
until it liquifies.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:19.810
So that's what you do when
you make liquid helium.

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:24.640
All right, any questions on
this lecture or any of the

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:34.210
concepts that we talked about?

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:39.610
The last thing that we're going
to do today then is to

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:43.120
look at a relationship which
is going to turn out to be

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.160
very useful.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.630
It's a relationship for ideal
gases which relates the heat

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:59.840
capacities at constant pressure
and constant volume.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:08.050
Cp = Cv + R. This is very useful
because often you just

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:11.670
have lots of tables of Cp's but
sometimes you want to know

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:15.350
what the energy change is going
to be for the ideal gas,

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:19.780
and you know that du
is Cv dT not Cp dT.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.350
So, you need to know what Cv
is, and if this is true

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.110
always, then there's a
very easy way to go

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:25.200
from one to the other.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.190
We're going to do it two ways.

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.820
Today we'll do the first way,
and then next time we'll do

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.770
the second way.

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:35.350
The first way is just to turn
the crank on the math, and the

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:37.930
second way is to do
a little bit more

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:41.720
imaginative about the process.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.360
OK, let's just turn the
crank on the maths.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.070
What do we know about
the Cp and Cv?

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:49.800
Well Cp, we already know how to
relate it to dH/dT through

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:54.480
the slope of the enthalpy, and
we also related Cv to the

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.480
slope of the energy with respect
to temperature under

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.840
constant volume.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.050
And we also know that
H is u plus pV.

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:07.520
Right, H is u plus pV.

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.630
So we're going to take the
derivatives of both sides of

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:13.680
this equation here, by, with
respect to temperature,

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.070
keeping pressure constant.

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:22.540
So we have dH/dT keeping
pressure constant, is du/dT

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.710
keeping pressure constant.

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.810
Got to keep track of what's
being constant, kept constant,

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:35.860
plus dPV/dT, keeping pressure
constant. dH/dT keeping

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:42.740
pressure constant, that's just
Cp, and then we have du/dT

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:43.950
keeping pressure constant.

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:47.760
The p is constant here, comes
out of the equation, so we

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.460
have p and then we have dV/dT
well it's an ideal gas, an

00:50:51.460 --> 00:51:00.420
ideal gas for dV/dT for an ideal
gas is equal to R over p

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:06.730
because pV is equal
to RT, right.

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:11.210
So dV/dT is Rp.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:16.672
So dV/dT is times R over
p, the p's are going

00:51:16.672 --> 00:51:19.380
to cancel out here.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:23.000
OK, so now it's very tempting
at this state to say, oh

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.550
there's the answer right
here. du/dT is Cv.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:33.320
There I have it Cp is equal
to Cv plus R, right?

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.750
But even though it looks like
that's the right way to do it,

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:38.850
it's actually not right because
it turns out to be

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:42.230
right by sort of by accident.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:50.750
But here you've got pressure
constant. du, this is du, not

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:58.160
H here. du/dT is only equal
to Cv when the volume is

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.010
constant, not when the
pressure is constant.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:03.130
So if you're going to turn the
crank on the math correctly,

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:08.660
you're going to have to change
this p into a V somehow.

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:10.895
Because this isn't Cv
mathematically speaking.

00:52:10.895 --> 00:52:13.610
We don't know what it is yet.

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:16.060
In order to change this from a
p to a V, you have to use the

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:19.040
chain rule.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:25.070
So let's use the chain rule.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:33.670
And then we'll be done.

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:37.040
OK, so u is actually a function
of temperature and

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.560
volume, which in this case here
could be a function of

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.900
pressure and temperature.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:49.480
So if we want du/dT under
constant pressure, you have to

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.230
use the chain rule.

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:52.510
There's the pressure
sitting right here.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:53:03.650
It's going to be du/dT under
constant volume, plus du/dV

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:08.860
dV/dT under constant pressure.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:22.140
All right, chain rule. du/dT
constant pressure is the

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:24.710
direct derivative with respect
to temperature here, which is

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:26.860
sitting by itself under constant
volume, keeping this

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:28.350
constant but there
is temperature

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.950
sitting right here too.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:33.260
That's where that term comes
from, du/dV dV/dT.

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.160
Now, for an ideal gas, du/dV
under constant temperature is

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:40.800
equal to zero.

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:45.360
It doesn't care what the
volume is doing.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.960
It only cares what
temperature is.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.880
If temperature is constant,
there's no change in energy.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.920
For an ideal gas,
this is zero.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.160
It's not zero for a real gas.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:58.080
Right, so this whole term
disappears and for an ideal

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.130
gas, it turns out that du/dT
constant pressure is equal to

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:06.550
du/dT constant volume, but
this is equal to Cv

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:07.490
for an ideal gas.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.210
It wouldn't be true for a real
gas, and this is a common

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.320
mistake that people make for
real gases to equate this.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.990
This is only true for
an ideal gas.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:19.835
Since it's true for an ideal
gas, then we can go ahead and

00:54:19.835 --> 00:54:27.790
replace this with Cv, and then
we have Cp with Cv plus R,

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:30.780
which is what we were after.

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:34.890
OK, next time we'll do the other
way of getting to the

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:36.440
same answer.
