00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.190
PROFESSOR: So, let me start
here with the temperature

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:37.400
dependence of k.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.800
And this turns out to be
extremely important.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:52.560
And it's due to Arrhenius
in 1889.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.980
And Mr. Arrhenius is famous
for many reasons.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.130
Not just for his rate law.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.900
So I learned recently, turns
out that he was also one of

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.900
the first people to calculate
the potential effect of carbon

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.950
dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.810
And and its potential effect
on global warming.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.000
This was the Industrial
Revolution and people were

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.890
starting to use fossil fuels
at increasing amounts.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.720
And back then, already, some
people started to get worried.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.130
And so he did the calculation.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.890
It was a very crude
calculation.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.590
And he extrapolated, assuming
that the rate to fossil fuel

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.670
use would keep going,
he got his

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.020
calculation pretty much right.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.610
What he didn't get right was the
amount of fossil fuel that

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.430
people would be using.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.230
And so when he did his
calculation, which is again a

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.560
very crude calculation, he got
that we would get in trouble

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.520
at about 2,000 years from the
time of his calculation.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.830
So he said, no problem,
2,000 years, we've

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.290
got a lot of time.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.130
And ever since then people have
redone these calculations

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.150
and more and more
sophisticated.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.180
But his crude calculation
was good enough.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.680
And as people redo the
calculations, the time that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.050
they say we're in trouble to
the time of the calculation

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.190
gets closer and closer
together.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.400
And the reason for that isn't
that their calculations are

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.810
wrong, it's that the rate at
which we put out carbon

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.520
dioxide just keeps getting
faster and faster and faster.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.250
So it's interesting to go back
to these calculations through

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.760
the last century and a
half and see that.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.360
Anyway, so Mr. Arrhenius
predicted global warming.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.860
And he wrote his rate equation,
k is equal to e to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.400
the minus Ea over RT.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.720
Famous Arrhenius
rate equation.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.800
If you plot it as log of k is
equal to log A minus Ea over

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.920
RT, you find that it looks
like a straight line.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.210
With an intercept at log A,
where A is the pre-factor here

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.100
and Ea is going to be the
activation energy.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.530
And the slope is Ea,
minus Ea over RT.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.460
R is the gas constant.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.490
T is the temperature.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.930
And if you put in some typical
numbers, activation energies

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.160
typically are on the order of
a few tens to hundreds of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.820
kilojoules per mole.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:44.130
Let's say 50 to 300 kilojoules
per mole.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.110
And typical activation
factors, typical

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.470
pre-exponential factors, are
depending if it's a first

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.220
order or second order.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.720
Let's say, first order 10 to the
12th, 10 to the 15th, per

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.260
second, so the A carries the
units for the rate here.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.210
So if you have A, so this is for
first order, if you have a

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.250
second order, then the units
of A will be different.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.890
And typically they're going to
be on the order of 10 to the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.890
11th or so, 10 to the 10th, 10
to the 12th, one over molar

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.870
per second, for second order.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.080
And it's interesting to do sort
of a back of the envelope

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:42.420
example to figure out how
important this rate is.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.980
And one of the interesting
things to look at is, suppose

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.430
that I'm at some temperature
and I want to know how do I

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.610
change the temperature.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.170
How much do I need to change
the temperature

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.460
to double the rate.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.860
And let's say my temperature's
at, say, T1 is on the order of

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.070
300 degrees Kelvin,
room temperature.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.020
Room temperature, and let's take
a typical Ea on the order

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.800
of 100 kilojoules per mole.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.990
Room temperature, or body
temperature are roughly the

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.920
same, right?

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.060
These things are.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.320
And so the question is, what
does T2 need to be to double

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.470
the rate connected with an
activation energy which is

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.790
fairly typical of 100
kilojoules per mole.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.370
So we want to know, what is, if
I have k2 over k1 is equal

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.970
to two, what's the new T2.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.780
Alright so A e to the minus Ea
over R T2 divided by A e to

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.250
the minus Ea over R T1, we want
that equal to two, the

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.660
A's cancel out.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:02.590
So log k2 over k1, which is
equal to log two, is equal to

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.880
Ea over R, one over T1
minus one over T2.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.520
We know what this is, we know
what this is, we solve for T2

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.380
and we find that T2 is
305 degrees kelvin.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.560
It's a pretty small change
to double the rate.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.670
So it's pretty important that
your body temperature doesn't

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.760
change very much.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.110
If you have a fever and your
temperature goes up, rates

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.700
start going up.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.710
In your body, you could cause a
lot of problems if the rates

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:50.180
of some reactions go up
by a factor of two.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.640
So, very sensitive
to temperature.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.890
Rates are very sensitive
to temperature.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.790
What are these things
physically?

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.840
Ea and and the pre-exponent
factor.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.970
Let's take a look at that.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.380
So physically what's going on
is, you have your two, let's

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:17.890
say it's a bimolecular reaction,
A plus B goes to C.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.190
So mechanistically what we think
is happening is that the

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.080
molecules come together
and collide, right?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.880
You have A and B getting
together and colliding.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.750
And the hypothesis
is that when they

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.680
collide they form a complex.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.600
They sort of bind together
momentarily.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.120
And form this complex that has
all the kinetic energy, or

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.940
part of the kinetic energy of
this collision as part of it.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.740
So A and B are bound
together in some

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.410
highly excited complex.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.380
Which then falls apart to give
the product by rearranging its

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.670
atoms around.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:13.060
And if you plot the energy of
this process as a function of

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:28.690
the reaction, we call this the
reaction coordinate, then

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:34.040
we're going to start at some
delta G, or some energy.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:40.440
For the reactants.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.920
We're going to end up with some
energy for the products.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.240
And it could be higher
or lower.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.260
Let me make them higher here,
just because I don't have

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.870
enough room on the board.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.620
Products.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.340
So if this is an endothermic
reaction, that's the energy

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.660
for C, this is the energy for
A plus B, and then along the

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:05.470
way we have this complex that
captures some of the energy of

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.970
the collision.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.650
Up here somewhere.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:18.320
And this is the energy, then, at
A B star, which we call the

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:25.310
activated complex.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.180
So for the reaction to happen,
then, we have to go over the

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.920
barrier and then back
to the product.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.400
And this distance from the
energy of the reactants to the

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.500
top of the barrier, that's Ea.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.970
That's the energy
of activation.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.410
How much extra energy you
have to put in there

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.310
to go over the barrier.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.790
So it's very clear that as you
increase the temperature and

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.530
you increase the amount of
energy that the reactants

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:58.010
thermally have, or in terms of
their kinetic energy, as you

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.040
raise the temperature you get
more and more kinetic energy,

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.510
you're going up higher and
higher in the Boltzmann

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.820
distribution.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.420
And the number of reactants
that can make it over the

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.330
barrier clearly goes
up exponentially.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.700
As the temperature goes up.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.870
So this is Ea for the
forward reaction.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.520
Clearly there's going to be an
equivalent activation energy

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.890
for the backward reaction.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.390
The two are related.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.640
The difference between the
forward and backward

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.970
reactions, so E backwards minus
Ea forward gives you the

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.330
delta G for the reaction
itself.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:46.040
So, Ea backwards minus Ea
forwards gives you delta E for

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.130
the reaction.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:55.220
Where E could be enthalpy or
it could be free energy.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.260
So that's the physical
origin of this Ea,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.980
this activation energy.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.740
Now, A, the pre-exponential
factor, that's the rate of

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:11.770
attempt for the molecules to
try to go over the barrier.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:27.170
So it has units that make
sense for that.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.070
And this A is different than
this molecule here.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.430
Rate of attempt.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.110
How many times per unit time, or
how many times per second,

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.080
do these two molecules
try to collide?

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.050
They never collide, they
never try, they'll

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:47.720
never make it over.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:58.260
So it's one over second, or
one over mole second.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.790
So this is the rate
of attempt.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:14.580
Then e to the minus Ea over RT
is the probability of success,

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.470
of making it over the barrier.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.480
So the rate of attempt times
the probability of success

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.430
gives you the rate
per unit time of

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:31.920
making it over the barrier.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.420
Any questions on the
dissection of this

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.090
Arrhenius rate law?

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:45.380
Alright, so here's some
examples, a few examples that

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.480
you know of.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:57.310
Let's look at OH minus
plus methyl bromide.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.390
Displacement reaction going to
this OH minus attacks the

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.490
carbon right here.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:11.350
To form an activated complex
H, H, H, with the OH

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.760
coming in like this.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.840
Let me go like this.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.030
OK, there's the intermediate
right here.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.950
The activated complex
in your reaction.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.100
Which then falls apart.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.390
It can fall apart two ways.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.560
The OH can be spit out again,
forming back to the reactants,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.310
or the bromine can be spit
out, forming the product.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:41.220
Which in this case
here is methanol.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:48.030
H, H, H, OH, plus Br minus.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.150
Typical example.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:56.440
So, given this picture here,
which you're probably already

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:03.350
somewhat familiar with, we can
then move on to talk about how

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.620
to affect this barrier.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.320
How to change the rate.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.910
Oh, I should say a couple
more things.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.390
One more thing, too.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:15.180
Now, the rate of, so clearly
the Ea's are related.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.010
Because the difference of the
two Ea's is the delta E for

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.030
the reaction.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:25.210
But the pre-exponential factors,
these A's, for the

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.530
forward reaction and the
backward reactions aren't

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.490
necessarily related.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.720
You can imagine that in one case
you have, first of all

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.830
they don't even have to
have the same units.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.610
You could have a bimolecular
reaction one way.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:42.430
And a unimolecular reaction
the other way.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.790
So you can't really say anything
about the forward

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.880
versus the backward
rate this way.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.430
All you know is about
the energies.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:15:01.950
OK, catalysis.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.560
So now we have this barrier
we have to overcome.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:14.550
And, so suppose that you
have two motivators.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.680
Suppose you have an equilibrium

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.460
case which is slow.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.210
And a reaction which
is slow in both

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:23.580
directions, k1, k minus one.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.710
And you don't want to wait
for this to happen.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.720
And this could be in a
biological environment.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.100
Or it could be an industrial
process,

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.370
like the Haber process.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.620
You don't want to wait.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.590
And so one of the ways that you
can speed it up, you know

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.960
is by changing the
temperature.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.190
You change the temperature,
the rate goes up.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.590
You change it by five degrees,
the rate goes up

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.690
by a factor of two.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.790
You can make a huge change by
changing the temperature.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:56.220
But, so if you raise
T, speeds up.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:02.750
But, K equilibrium
also changes.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.950
And we saw that when we
did the Haber process.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.020
We raised the temperature.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.110
The rate speeds up, but
the equilibrium

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.610
switches to the reactants.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.970
That's no good.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.090
So changing the temperature is
not always the best thing to

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.900
do if you want to
change the rate.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:26.990
Instead, what you can do
is use a catalyst.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.330
if you find one.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:38.240
A molecule that reacts with
your reactant to form a

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.900
product, that's B, spitting
back that molecule C again

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.410
without using it up.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.450
And now with the activation
energy, we can understand what

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.960
the catalyst does.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.820
What the catalyst does is speeds
up those rates, k2 and

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:02.110
k minus one, by changing
the activation energy.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.590
By making the E smaller.

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:08.630
So now I have a catalyst,
and I can

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.690
make this energy smaller.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:26.270
So this would be A plus A C
activated, getting ready to

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.630
spit out B.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.480
So in my example here where
I have A plus B goes to

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.000
products, so I would have A,
some combination of A, B, and

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.150
C together, to give
out the products.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.280
In this case, the difference
in energies doesn't change.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:51.850
All that you're changing is that
the hump, in both ways.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.230
Equilibrium constant
doesn't change.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:58.190
Just the rate changes through
the Arrhenius rate law.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.470
And this is extremely
powerful.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.330
Especially in biology.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:10.300
So let me give you some
examples here.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:16.580
This is sort of a typical
example of increasing rates.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.910
Let's say you have the reaction,
hydrogen peroxide,

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:28.270
goes to water plus oxygen.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.530
If you take a little bit of
hydrogen peroxide and you put

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.060
it on your skin, it
starts to bubble.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.660
But if you let it sit on the
bottle nothing happens to it.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.890
Put it on your hair, your
hair turns white.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.500
Blond.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.670
But again, if you just
let it sit in the

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.400
bottle very little happens.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.570
Well, it happens but very,
very slowly over time.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:56.690
So if you look at the rate of
this reaction here, if the

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:05.700
rate, moles per second, with no
catalyst at all, the rate

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.580
is 10 to the minus 8
molar per second.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.570
Which is very slow.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:21.740
And the activation energy in
kilojoules per mole, in this

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.720
case here is 71 kilojoules
per mole.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.110
Now we can start adding
catalysts.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.730
We can start adding inorganic
catalysts

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.850
like hydrogen bromide.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.710
Increase the rate at
10 to the minus 4.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:40.320
So this creates a complex with
the hydrogen peroxide, which

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.910
lowers the barrier to 50
kilojoules per mole, a small

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:46.720
amount of lowering.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.740
But because the energy is in the
exponent there, it makes a

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.860
big change in the rate.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.180
Yes.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:20:01.270
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.420
PROFESSOR: The rate is
independent of the catalyst

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.700
concentration.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.300
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.980
PROFESSOR: The rate would
have to change.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:19.070
You're right.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:24.530
That's a good question and I'm
not prepared to answer it.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.890
I'm going to have to
think about this.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:31.840
Let's pretend now that we are
at per unit concentration of

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.550
the catalyst.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.410
And then, and I'll
look into it.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.700
OK, so this is what happens with
an inorganic catalyst.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:46.890
And instead if you use a generic
biological catalyst,

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.690
an enzyme catalase, it's a sort
ubiquitous enzyme which

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.510
is why you have it on your skin,
et cetera, then this

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.680
rate become 10 to the 7th.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:05.170
And the activation energy
drops to eight

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.420
kilojoules per mole.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.170
So your question really has to
do with the units of A. Of the

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:17.030
pre-factor right there.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.940
OK, and so there are all these
examples of reactions.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.430
That are very important
biologically.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.010
Where with an inorganic
catalyst, an organic catalyst,

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.780
you can change the
rate by maybe a

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.340
few orders of magnitude.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.610
But as soon as you put in an
enzyme, the rate changes by

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.060
ten orders of magnitude.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.050
Or in this case eight
plus seven,

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.100
fifteen orders of magnitude.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.500
Humongous change in the rate.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.080
So you've probably done some
enzyme catalysis before.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:22:04.740
But it's probably a good idea
to quickly do it again.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.010
Because it's just
so important.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:11.430
And it ties together our
approximations that we've

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.510
learned about.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.990
So enzyme catalysis, so enzymes
can be either, could

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.700
be heterogeneous catalysis, can
be homogeneous catalysis.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.960
Enzymes are ubiquitous in the
biological environment.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.450
They serve to regulate the
cellular activity in very

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:35.550
complicated ways.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:40.050
The cell will up-regulate
or down-regulate the

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.780
concentration of enzymes
as it needs to make

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.440
more or less products.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.470
And there's whole cascades
of events that

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:52.040
happen in this way.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.500
And they're in very small
concentrations.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.560
But they play an extremely
important role.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.190
Because they're also
extremely specific.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:06.740
So you can have an enzyme that
will only act on one part of

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.070
the biological cycle.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.590
And affect it by 10 orders
of magnitude or

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.590
15 orders of magnitude.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.960
But not affect any other
protein that's around.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.540
And that's amazing.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:29.790
And it turns out that a lot of
the diseases of old age like,

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:34.920
what I'm about to face, or am
facing already, you, not yet,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:44.360
but, are the result of some of
these enzyme up-regulation,

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.250
down-regulation, beginning
to break down.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:52.560
So we have all these reactions
going on that need to be

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.840
essentially perfect.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.330
When you have DNA replication
or protein folding,

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.240
or things like this.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.500
And errors are made.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.280
Errors are made all the time
in these processes.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.770
And errors cause diseases.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:15.160
And so, even as a baby,
your biological

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.120
processes make errors.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.260
But you have these processes,
these enzymes especially based

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:25.060
on enzymes, that can go in there
and sort of fix things.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:29.350
Fix things and make sure that
you don't end up getting

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:33.260
Alzheimer's at age six months.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:40.360
But as we get older, for some
reason, these repair processes

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.740
lose their bearings.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.850
Just like we lose
our bearings.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:48.090
And and they can't repair
things any more.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.460
They don't do it very well.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.320
And that causes all
sorts of diseases.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.380
Cancer is probably one of the
diseases, due to the lack of

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.270
being able to repair problems.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.000
Alzheimer's.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.990
All sorts of dementias.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.620
MS. Just name a chronic disease
and it's probably due

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.170
to a problem with
up-regulation or

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.315
down-regulation of some
proteins, some enzymes, that

00:25:12.315 --> 00:25:17.550
are due to a repair process.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:25.360
So anyway, these enzymes
are big proteins.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.090
10 to the 4th, 10 to the 6th
molecular weight proteins.

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.810
On that order or so.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:35.310
They tend to be fairly
large in size.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.060
On the order of nanometers.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.570
Let's say ten nanometers
to 100 nanometers.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.620
That could be, that's a little
bit on the big side.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.590
Probably closer to
ten nanometers.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.180
Ten nanometers is kind
of big, for any sort

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:51.860
of biological molecule.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.750
And they always end with
their name ase.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:26:00.810
Like catalase, uriase, rnase.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:04.210
Esterase, clips ester bonds.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.040
Your liver is full
of esterases.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.450
Because it likes to break things
down into smaller and

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.190
smaller pieces and lots of ester
bonds and things that

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.380
are not very biologically
interesting.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:22.100
And that's one way of the liver
breaking things down.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:29.450
So the way it works is that you
have your reactants, which

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:39.970
in the biological language are
called your substrate, come

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:44.230
in, into an enzyme.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:50.700
Gets bound up in a pocket
of, there's

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.430
the substrate, reactant.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.520
There's the enzyme here.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.740
Forms a complex.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:06.470
And then product
gets spit out.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.400
And the product floats off.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.230
And does its thing.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.430
It probably gets bound to
another enzyme, which makes

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.110
another product.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.030
Et cetera, and the
cascade goes on.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.400
The signaling cascade goes on.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.220
And this enzyme is in very
small concentration.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.260
The product goes away, so that's
going to stay as a very

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:32.350
small concentration as well.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:44.220
So let's observe experimentally,
then.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:50.620
Experimentally, what's seen is
that the substrate makes

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:55.130
products in the presence
of the enzyme.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:28:03.030
With a rate dP/dt, that's, at
t equals zero this is the

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.200
initial rate is proportional
to the

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.310
concentration of the enzyme.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:10.890
This is initial rate.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.250
And in the language of enzymatic
kinetics, this is

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:20.130
called the velocity. dP/dt is
also called the velocity.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.830
Velocity, moles per unit time.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.100
And this would be called, then,
the initial velocity of

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.070
v initial. v initial's
proportional to the enzyme

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:33.040
concentration.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.090
And what else is seen?

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:41.800
For fixed, if I fix my
concentration of enzyme, I

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.390
look at the velocity over time,
let's say minus dS/dt,

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:58.250
which is dP/dt, I find that
that's proportional to S. For

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:03.940
small S. Small concentration
of substrate.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:04.710
And then at large

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:13.750
concentration, it's a constant.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:22.690
So it's not a straight line.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:28.870
In fact, I don't want to do
it on this board here.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:41.870
I'll do it on this board here.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:44.070
Plot the concentration of
substrate on this axis, and I

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:48.120
plot the velocity, or the
rate, of the reaction

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.650
on that axis here.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:53.210
What I find is that
it's a constant.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.690
So it's going to saturate, the
rate is going to saturate to

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.580
some number.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.420
And it's going to start
linear with

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.570
substrate at the beginning.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.160
So it's going to be a straight
line at the beginning.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.210
And eventually it
will saturate.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:09.670
That sort of slope.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:14.050
And the saturation point, that's
the maximum velocity,

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.050
or maximum rate that
it can have.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.240
So we call this v max.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:34.010
And this part here, the velocity
is proportional to S.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:39.230
And somehow we have to
find, explain this.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:43.140
Using what we know
from kinetics.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.430
So we have to come up with
a mechanism, and

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.150
then solve the mechanism.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:53.230
And make sure that it
reproduces the data.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.800
So we're not the first ones
to do this, obviously.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:02.830
Michaelis and Menton did
this many years ago.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.420
For this mechanism.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:10.200
And the idea is, you have the
enzyme plus a substrate react,

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:15.010
k1, k minus one, to
form a complex.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.510
Enzyme substrate complex.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:20.500
But unlike what we've drawn
before in terms of this hump,

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.140
where there's an activated
complex which is not stable,

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:28.520
in this case here this enzyme
substrate combination lasts a

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:36.700
long enough time that it's
basically a stable complex.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.290
So we're going to write this
as a real intermediate that

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.150
lasts long enough for you to
be able to fish it out.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.300
And characterize it.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:52.900
And then eventually, that, k2,
k minus two, goes to product

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.130
plus enzyme.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:58.500
So the enzyme is a catalyst
that forms

00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.940
a long-lived complex.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:04.650
And if you were to draw this,
then, in our energy diagram,

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:10.500
where we have the reaction
coordinate here, you start out

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:16.590
with your enzyme
plus substrate.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:23.000
Go up, and you form your
intermediate up here.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.700
ES.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.860
And I put a little dimple in
there, because it's stable

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.040
enough that it's not on the top
of the hump, but it lives

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.880
long enough.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:38.080
And it comes back down
to form the product.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.710
Plus the enzyme.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.160
Without the enzyme in there,
this hump would

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.660
be way, way up there.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.550
Would be maybe a factor
of ten higher.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.760
So this really lowers
it a lot.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.510
Now we can start to solve
this mechanism.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.650
And I forgot one arrow.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:00.070
There which is the
arrow going back.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.680
Which you usually don't
see, but we might as

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.180
well keep it there.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:15.490
For the sake of completeness.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:16.190
So what do we know?

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:22.210
We know that this intermediate
concentration is very small.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.340
The enzyme concentration
itself is very small.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.420
Intermediate is very small.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.420
And it doesn't change
very much.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:36.540
Not changing much.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.860
So that means that we need
to use a steady state

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.500
approximation.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:46.210
So let's write down
the rate for this

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.200
intermediate, d[ES]/dt.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.760
It gets formed through
the forward process.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.160
I'm going to put my brackets
back in because E and ES would

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.280
look the same otherwise.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.990
Gets destroyed.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.910
Through the backward ways.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.570
And I'm going to use a steady
state approximation.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.950
So I'm already going to start
adding steady state here every

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.460
time I see an intermediate.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:15.490
Get it destroyed to
make products.

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:17.030
It gets recreated through
the backwards

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:24.320
reaction from the products.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.030
And I'm going to set that equal
to zero for the steady

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.710
state approximation.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:33.240
Now, we don't really
want to have this E

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.050
floating around here.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:37.840
Because this is something that
is very hard to measure.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.700
It's much easier to measure the
initial concentration of

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.900
the enzyme.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.240
What you put in there, instead
of the amount that's

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.330
not being bound up.

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:51.980
So we're going to solve,
instead, in terms of [E] is

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.550
equal to [E]0 minus [ES], where
this is the initial

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.040
concentration and this
is the amount

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.620
that's binding substrate.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.710
And this is the amount of
free enzyme here then.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:08.500
And when you do that, and you
plug in here, and you plug in

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:14.300
here, you get your result.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:33.950
Which is that [E] steady state,
[ES] steady state, is

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:42.250
this ratio. k1 times [S] plus k
minus two times the product

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:52.520
divided by k minus one plus k2
plus k1 times [S] plus k minus

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:58.680
two times the product, times
proportional to the initial

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:05.330
concentration of enzyme.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:10.430
And then you can take your
steady state approximation for

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:30.220
the intermediate and plug it
back into your rate equation.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:35.950
So the velocity, we defined
as the rate which is minus

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:46.200
d[S]/dt, which is k1 times [E]
times [S], this is the

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:52.400
destruction of the substrate
minus k minus one, times [ES]

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.760
steady state, the backwards
process.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.160
So we put in, instead of this
[E] we put in [E] is equal to

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.010
[E]0 minus [ES]

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:10.910
steady state.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:12.340
And then we put in for [ES]

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.680
steady state, we put in
what we found here.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.990
We turn the crank
on the algebra.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:27.590
And we find that the velocity,
then, is k1 k2 times the

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:29.800
substrate concentration.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.730
Minus k minus one times k minus
two times the product

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.780
concentration.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:44.760
The whole thing times the
initial enzyme concentration.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.320
And then k minus one plus
k2 on the bottom.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:57.870
Plus k1 [S] plus k minus
two times the product.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:07.380
So, as I mentioned, this product
here usually just

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.070
floats away.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:13.640
And so locally, where you're
doing the, and then it gets

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.070
used by the next step
in the cycle.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:20.430
So this is pretty much zero.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.740
We can pretty much
ignore this.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.680
We can ignore this
guy here too.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.920
Because it's not, you don't have
any steady state or an

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.300
equilibrium.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.480
You have a steady state but not
an equilibrium situation.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:40.810
And so in that case here, you
can rewrite this then as k1 k2

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:49.860
times the substrate times [E]0
divided by k minus one plus k2

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.710
plus k1 times the substrate.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:39:00.820
And now we can look at these
experimental observations and

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:05.070
see whether they match
our mechanism.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:12.880
If we can understand
something.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.220
So let's look at the
initial rate.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:19.760
Initial rate is supposed to be
proportional to the substrate.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.640
Initial rate is supposed to be
proportional to the substrate.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:34.110
So the initial rate, k1
k2 plus k1, if at

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:43.770
early times, plus one.

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:56.370
So the initial rate is going
to be, somehow I've got the

00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:08.540
product missing here.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.670
No, I got it backwards here.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.400
This is not the initial rate.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:19.460
This is the rate where
[S] is small.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.400
The initial rate is when you
don't have any products made.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.830
Or when the product
concentration is very low.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.960
And because we're making the
assumption that the product

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.660
concentration is basically equal
to zero here, this is

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.490
basically the initial
rate here.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.740
So by taking the product equal
to zero here, we're also

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:41.720
saying that this is the same
thing as the initial rate.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.610
So this is what it
looks like here..

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:45.970
The initial rate here.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:56.050
And this is, this, you rewrite
as v initial is equal to k2

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.700
times [S] times [E]0.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:02.040
You divide by k1 up and down.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:09.750
And you have this k minus one
plus k2 over k1 and then plus

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.500
[S] sitting down there.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:17.930
And you define this ratio of
rates, k minus one plus k2

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:23.130
over k1 as the KM, the Michaelis
constant, by

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.180
definition.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.460
And this is an interesting
ratio.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.260
This is the rate, k minus one is
the rate of destroying the

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.870
enzyme substrate complex by
going back to the reactants.

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.990
k2 is the destruction
of the complex by

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:38.470
going to the product.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:40.980
And k1's the creation
of the complex.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.500
So this is the rate of
destruction of the complex

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.420
divided by the rate of creation
of the complex.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.130
So if the rate of destruction of
the complex is much faster

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:56.250
than the rate of creation,
meaning that this is a large

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:59.900
number, then you're not going
to pile up any complex.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.930
It's going to be destroyed
as soon as you create it.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:11.280
So if KM is large, then the
concentration, [ES], is going

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.050
to be very small.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:15.600
Compared to [E]0.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.830
But if the rate of destruction
of the complex is small

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.970
compared to the rate of
creation, you create

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:24.450
complexes, you create complexes
but you don't keep

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.540
up in terms of destroying
them, in terms of making

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.060
products, or going back
to reactants.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.430
And so you end up saturating
your enzyme.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:38.280
Every enzyme ends up having
substrate bound to it.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:51.780
So when KM is very small, then
[ES] goes to saturation.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:56.740
Basically, when KM is very
small, then you're limited by

00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:01.040
the rate, the second rate in
the process, of the enzyme

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.800
falling apart.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.130
To form the product.

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:06.010
You have to wait until
that happens.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:09.710
Because then the product
just floats away.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:14.650
And that becomes your
rate limiting step.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:20.070
Another way that you also will
see this written is as this,

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:27.860
then, is equal to, we'll define
k cat is equal to k2. k

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:33.220
cat times the enzyme
concentration times the

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:39.520
substrate, [E]0, divided by
KM plus but the substrate

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:46.620
concentration.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.720
So let's look at a few
limiting cases then.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:59.070
First limiting case is, suppose,
that [S] is large.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:03.600
Let's take [S] to be much
larger than KM.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.590
Because you look at the
denominator, and you see it's

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.610
this ratio of rates but there's
this concentration

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:12.410
that's important here.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:14.730
So in one case KM is going to
dominate, and in the other

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.570
limiting case the substrate

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:17.920
concentration is going to dominate.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.480
So let's say that the substrate

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.600
concentration dominates.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.690
Meaning K sub M is small.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:23.630
In which case we already saw.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:27.620
If K sub M is small then
you reach saturation.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:33.730
And in the equation, then, the
velocity, KM is small, [S] is

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:38.860
large, the [S]'s cancel out and
the velocity is equal to k

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:43.180
cat times the initial substrate
concentration.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.740
Both of these are constants.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.290
The velocity is constant.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:50.850
And the rate is constant,
it's that limit up here.

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:55.880
That's experimentally seen.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.670
And the rate is depending
on the initial substrate

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:01.430
concentration.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:02.600
Initial enzyme concentration.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.550
All the enzymes have a
substrate in there.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:07.160
The more enzymes you have
to begin with, the more

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.860
intermediates you're going to
have, the faster you going to

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.000
make products.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.860
And then it's going to depend
on this on the rate, k cat,

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.450
which is just k2, which is the
rate of formation of products.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:24.530
That becomes the rate
limiting step here.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:29.710
The other special case is if
substrate concentration is

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:33.400
very small compared to KM.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.725
And in that case here, and the
other thing that we're going

00:45:38.725 --> 00:45:43.830
to do is, we're going to,
because we now understand this

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:46.920
as this maximum rate up there,
we're going to call this v

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.480
max. k cat times [E]0, we're
going to call it v max.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:46:01.180
And so when [S] is very small,
v, then, is equal to v max,

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.040
which is k cat times [E]0.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.380
This is v max here now.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:12.130
So we can rewrite this as v max
times substrate divided by

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.130
KM plus the substrate
concentration.

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:15.880
Another way of writing it.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.690
Capital K.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:23.550
v max times the substrate
concentration.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:25.510
And we have KM plus [S].

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.560
But [S] is very small.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.810
So we drop it.

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:32.520
And this is then proportional
to the substrate

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.280
concentration.

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.560
And then that's small substrate
concentration

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.460
compared to KM, we're
sitting right here.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.800
Where it's linear, where
the rate is linear.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.690
And there's a third place
on the graph which is

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:46.350
interesting.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:52.000
Which is when the substrate
concentration is equal to KM.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.410
In that case there, you plug [S]
equal to KM, and you end

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:04.810
up with the velocity then is
equal to v max divided by two.

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:10.860
So when [S] is equal to KM,
you are halfway up.

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:18.160
There's v max over two and
there's KM sitting here.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:24.690
When [S] is equal to KM, you're
at v max over two.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.930
And so enzymes, then, are
labeled by their KM's.

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:31.280
Because then it becomes very
important to know how strongly

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.900
they bind the substrate.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.440
Sometimes you want the enzyme
to bind it very strongly.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.170
Sometimes you don't, you
want it to be fleeting.

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:45.820
Depends on the role that
the enzyme plays.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:52.480
Now there's a way to plot this
that extracts out these

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.540
important numbers.
k cat and KM.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.770
And that's the Lineweaver-Burk
plot..

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:06.560
Lineweaver-Burk plot..

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.630
And I just looked up this
morning to see if Mr.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:09.600
Lineweaver was still alive.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.730
And as far as I can tell
he's still alive.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:17.900
He was 97, in 2003.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:22.220
So as of 2007 he was
still alive.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.140
He's getting up there.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.970
One of the most cited papers
that you have in your notes is

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:31.580
the in Jack's, was the paper
that showed how to go from

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:38.690
this curved line to a straight
line by plotting one over v

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:42.660
versus [S], instead
of v versus [S].

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:51.660
So if you take your equation and
massage it, one over v KM

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:57.740
over v max times [S], plus one
over v max, we haven't done

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.720
anything except rewrite the
equation in terms of one of v

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:05.540
versus one over [S].

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:08.400
So it becomes linear.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:14.260
In one over [S], and there's
one over v sitting here.

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.890
And you get a straight line.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:23.080
With an intercept here that's
one over v max.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:29.610
And if you keep going,
extrapolate out, you get this

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:40.010
point here to be minus 1
over KM and the slope

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:45.500
is KM over v max.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.950
And v max was equal to k cat
times [E]0, so you get k cat

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:53.100
out of this.

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:57.850
So it turned out to be
a very useful plot.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:59.460
It's very easy to plot a
straight line, especially

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.500
before computers.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.120
In the age of computers.

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:06.950
And the referees, there were
six referees that got this

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:09.880
paper and pretty much turned
it down because they didn't

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.640
think there was any new
chemistry in it.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.250
Which is true, there's
no new chemistry.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.040
It's just a way of rewriting
the plot.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.980
But it was very important
nevertheless.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:24.500
OK, any questions on catalysis?

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.670
Enzymes?

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:30.710
Arrhenius?

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:35.250
Alright, next time we'll
oscillating reactions and

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:36.990
recap the course.
