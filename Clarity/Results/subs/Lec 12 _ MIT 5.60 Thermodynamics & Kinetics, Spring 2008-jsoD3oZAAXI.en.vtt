00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.390
PROFESSOR NELSON: So, over the
last few lectures we've worked

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.650
and struggled so formulate the
second and third laws of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.150
thermodynamics in addition
to the first.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.900
Last time we reach the third law
which is telling us that

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.450
we can't quite get to zero
degrees Kelvin, but that as

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.020
the temperature approaches
zero degrees Kelvin, the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.950
absolute entropy of a pure
substance in perfect

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.270
crystalline form is zero.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.900
And what that corresponds to,
if you recall, is the idea

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.700
that in a perfect crystal at
zero degrees Kelvin then you

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.060
have no disorder at all.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.000
You have a perfectly
ordered system.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.230
And in that case, the entropy
is absolutely zero.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.410
And the bigger lesson from that
is that entropy, unlike

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.260
energy u or enthalpy H, we could
define an absolutely

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.490
number for it.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.430
The zero of it wasn't
arbitrary.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.020
Unlike the case for energy like
you've seen in lots and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.150
lots of disciplines, where you
can arbitrarily set the zero

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.260
in a way that makes it
convenient for you.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.390
Entropy really is
not like that.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.540
There is an absolute zero of
entropy, and that's really

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.910
what we learn.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.350
So now, now that we've got all
three of the major laws of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.770
thermodynamics, what I want to
start in on is a discussion of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.420
what happens spontaneously.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.590
We've seen that in just one
specialized case so far, but

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.580
we should in a more general way
be able to tell when is a

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.440
system at equilibrium, where
there's no net change taking

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.910
place, and when is it still
undergoing spontaneous change

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.860
towards some other state,
presumably toward an

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.180
equilibrium state.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.320
How do we tell?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.310
So that's the topic that I'd
like to address today.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:40.350
So, that's the big
question, right?

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:52.580
So let's say that we've got
our stuff in some state.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.130
A, whatever it is.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.830
And there's some other
possible state,

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.050
B, whatever it is.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.920
And maybe if it some
well-defined

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.470
temperature and pressure.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.360
What do we do to tell whether
that change will happen

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.890
spontaneously?

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.070
Do we calculate, you know, delta
S, delta u, delta H?

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.830
What tells us whether or
not the change happens?

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.770
Certainly in principle we know
how to calculate this and

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.570
other stuff for a change in
state of this sort, for lots

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.710
of changes of state.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.920
But calculating it alone doesn't
necessarily tell us

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.490
whether or not it will just
happened of its own accord.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.860
And that's the issue that we'd
like to be able to address.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.330
Now, we have addressed
this in some cases.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:59.310
So, for example, we know that
if we take, you know, gas A

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.980
and gas B with a barrier between
them, and we remove

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:15.360
the barrier, they're
going to mix.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.690
And we saw that and went through
it somewhat carefully

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:31.350
and saw that if the system is
isolated, for that case we do

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.170
have a criterion that tells
us whether change happens

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.730
spontaneously.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:54.520
Namely, it's delta S is
greater than zero.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.790
That tells us whether the
change is spontaneous.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.280
And we saw that in fact in this
case delta S of mixing,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.520
we calculated it, saw
that it is positive.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.230
So, clearly, if we remove this
barrier mixing takes place,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.040
and obviously you know that
that happens from lots of

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.350
experience.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.370
In general, the second law
gave us the Clausius

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.800
inequality for spontaneous
change.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:35.730
Namely dS is greater than dq
over T. I suppose we could

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.490
specify the surroundings
temperature.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.940
We saw that in general dS is
greater than or equal to dq

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.660
over T. if it's a reversible
process then the equality

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.410
holds, but if it's irreversible,
which means it

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:29.300
happens spontaneously, then
dS is greater than this.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.990
Just to illustrate the kind of
issues that we're up against

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.990
here, let me just consider
a few different chemical

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.590
reactions, all of which
happen spontaneously.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.140
So, I just want to write a few
examples down with a few

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:55.540
values for delta u or delta H or
delta S, and see whether we

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.220
can get any clues from
what we see.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:11.670
So here are some spontaneous
chemical changes.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.550
Here's one.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:21.910
If we take hydrogen peroxide
in the liquid state, it can

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:29.890
break down to form
water and oxygen.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.660
If we look at the thermodynamic
quantities, the

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.670
enthalpy and the entropy of the
reaction, what we find is

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:44.100
delta H is minus 209 kiloJoules
and delta S is plus

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:52.260
132 joules per Kelvin.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.250
So it seems like there's a
favorable change in entropy

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:57.980
going this way.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.140
That is, you've got lower energy
on the right and also

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.070
higher entropy.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.870
Higher entropy basically
because you're forming

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.660
molecules of gas where there
weren't any before, and

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.530
there's more disorder in the gas
phase than in the liquid.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.980
That is, the gas phase
molecules have

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.270
more freedom to roam.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.540
Okay, that's one example.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.200
Here's another.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:27.655
Let's just take hydrogen and
nitrogen in the gas phase and

00:08:27.655 --> 00:08:32.390
form ammonia.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:38.860
Well, here we get, we find that
delta H is negative 92

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.610
kiloJoules.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:47.910
Delta S is negative 198
joules per Kelvin.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.280
This one also happens
spontaneously.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.820
One thing that makes it pretty
clear is that certainly delta

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.200
S or the sign of
it alone is not

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.580
dictating the outcome here.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.750
All right, here's
a third example.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:15.660
Let's take salt, solid, and
dissolve it in a bunch of

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.530
liquid water.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.050
Hopefully you've got experience
saying that this

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:31.910
happens, of course it does.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.800
If we measure the
thermodynamics, we discover

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.560
that delta H is 4 kiloJoules,
plus 4 kiloJoules.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:47.530
Delta S is 45 joules
per Kelvin.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:51.460
So now we have a different sign
for delta H and it still

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.650
happens spontaneously.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:00.280
So clearly, we've got signs and
magnitudes of delta H and

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.490
delta S, and if we wanted to
put delta u there, similar

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.500
things would happen.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.310
They're all over the map.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:12.620
And yet, these things are all
spontaneous processes.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.420
And I didn't specify the
conditions, but if we were to

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.210
do this under ordinary chemical
conditions of some,

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.480
you'd say room temperature and
pressure, right, they all

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.800
happen spontaneously.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.850
OK, clearly we'd be much better
off if we had some

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:36.320
systematic quantitative way to
tell whether something would

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.280
happen spontaneously.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.550
In other words, we need criteria
for equilibrium under

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.590
more general conditions than the
ones that we've dealt with

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.890
so far, than the one set of
conditions that we've dealt

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.420
with so far, which is
isolated system.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.780
Most chemical changes, most
physical changes don't happen

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.020
in isolated systems.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:26.840
So let's start by writing down
our definition of equilibrium.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.560
It's very simple.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.160
The equilibrium state is the
one, and it's just one, in

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.400
which there are no spontaneous
changes that can take place to

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.700
any other state.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.340
Now that's under whatever
constraints there are.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.360
There's a box around it.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.560
The temperature or
the pressure are

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.730
fixed, what have you.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:12:08.150
But the point is, no spontaneous
changes can occur

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.930
to any other state.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:17.680
So for example, when we remove
the barrier and the gases mix,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.890
you know it's over.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.780
Once the gases are mixed,
there's not going to be any

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:27.340
further net change
in the system.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.130
It's at equilibrium, under the
new condition, that is with

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.430
the barrier removed.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:39.830
OK, so now let's try to
formulate how to describe the

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.590
equilibrium state and what
dictates spontaneity.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.710
So what we're going to
do is consider the

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.320
first and second laws.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:56.890
So our first law, du
is dq plus dw.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:13.180
And our second law, dS is
greater than dq over the

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:25.010
temperature of surroundings
for a change that happens

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.370
spontaneously.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.430
And now, I want to combine
these two, which I

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.640
of course can do.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:40.280
I can substitute dq from this
expression in here.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.600
I also want to assume for our
present purposes that there's

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.810
only pressure volume work going
on, which is to say I

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.380
want to put p dV in here
minus p dV for dw.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:11.810
So for combining for p V work,
what we see then is du has to

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:20.670
be less than T surroundings
dS minus p external dV.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:36.740
Or we can rewrite this as du
plus external pressure dV

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:43.580
minus T surroundings dS
is less than zero.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.970
Now this is fundamentally
important, and as you know

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:54.700
that means that it warrants
the exalted distinction of

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.250
being put up in colored chalk.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.030
And, in fact, since we're going
to reuse this again and

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.460
again during today's lecture,
I'm going to put it over here

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:08.170
and leave it sacrosanct for
our further use. du plus p

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:14.380
external dV minus T
surroundings dS

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:19.300
is less than zero.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:29.890
This Is our condition for
spontaneous change.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:35.350
Now this is a really quite
useful expression.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.820
For one thing what we have
here are all functions of

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:47.330
state and parameters that we can
control like temperature

00:15:47.330 --> 00:16:09.910
and pressure.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.940
So that's a big help.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:17.510
And equilibrium happens when
there isn't any possible

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:22.480
change of state that
would satisfy this.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:37.690
In other words, you've got your
system in some state.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.680
You know it's in some state
A, there are some

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.200
other states around.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.590
Here is what we calculate to
tell whether it happens

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.640
spontaneously.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.020
So we now have a real usable
criterion to help guide our

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.710
understanding of whether things
happen by themselves of

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:05.180
their own accord or not.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.890
Now, this is still a little
bit cumbersome, in part

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.850
because of the variables
involved, including S. That

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:19.170
is, most processes that we're
concerned with, they'll happen

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.550
with something held constant
like pressure or temperature

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.330
or maybe volume.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:28.310
So this isn't the most useful
form that we can have, but

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:33.350
what we'll see shortly is that
from this, we can then derive

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.800
further criteria for essentially
any set of

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.870
variables or any set of external
constraints, like

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.980
constant temperature or pressure
or volume and so

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.330
forth that we might set.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:58.520
And so that's what
I now want to do.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.810
So I just want to use that again
and again, starting from

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.560
that, for various different
sorts of conditions and derive

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:29.500
the criterion for equilibrium
in each set of conditions.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.760
So first, let's start with the
one that we already know, and

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:43.490
make sure that it still works,
starting from here, mainly our

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.640
isolated system.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.060
So remember what that means?

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.750
It means no heat, no work.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.720
Delta V is zero.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.000
Delta u is zero.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:05.580
So looking at this, du
is zero. dV is zero.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:12.050
So all that's left is negative
T dS is less than zero.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:18.020
In other words, T surrounding
dS has to be greater than

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:18.880
zero, and of course

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.670
temperature is always positive.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:32.180
So dS for u and V fixed
is greater than zero.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.750
All right, so that's
sounds right.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.310
That's what we saw before.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.060
When we have an isolated system,
the criterion that

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.020
determines whether something
happens spontaneously is the

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:49.130
entropy has to increase.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:20:04.910
Now, what this means too is
if we imagine a bunch of

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.810
different states, and this is
the entropy of them, so this

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.300
could be any sort of variable
but the point is there are a

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:25.210
bunch of possible states around,
whichever one has the

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:33.620
maximum entropy, that's
the equilibrium state.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.260
In other words, you know we've
got the two gases on either

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.660
side of that partition.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.690
We remove the partition,
and they mix.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.050
Well, the equilibrium state
is the one with the gases

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.130
completely mixed.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.580
Of course there are lots of
states that would have maybe

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:54.270
local pockets of one substance
in excess and another

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.200
substance in excess
somewhere else.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.140
In other words, there would be
lots of states nearby to the

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.200
equilibrium state.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.550
That is, the chain, they could
they could be approached with

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.850
very little change from
the equilibrium state.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.220
They aren't the equilibrium
state.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.580
The entropy in all of those
states will be lower than the

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:18.330
entropy of the fully
mixed state.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.010
So the point is, once you're
at equilibrium none of the

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.700
other states, they're
accessible, the system could

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.330
rearrange itself to form them,
but there is no accessible

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:39.630
state that has higher entropy
than the equilibrium state.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:52.690
OK, that's our familiar
isolated system.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:58.260
Now let's try moving to
unfamiliar territory and

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:08.060
extending what we know.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:19.750
So, let's try constant
entropy and volume.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.810
And the motivation for choosing
a pair like that is

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.710
easy to see, if we look at our
condition for spontaneous

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.510
change or general condition.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.780
Well, entropy and volume
constant means dV and dS are

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.930
equal to zero.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.760
What does that say?

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.770
It means du is less than zero.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.420
That's our condition.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:46.102
So we immediately get du
at constant S and V

00:22:46.102 --> 00:22:51.700
is less than zero.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:23:01.050
That's our condition for
spontaneous change.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.100
In other words, if we don't have
to worry about entropy or

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.960
volume equilibrium is achieved
when energy is at a minimum.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.060
Now this is what you learn in
elementary physics and in

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.130
mechanics, right.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.450
You're not worried
about entropy.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:22.170
So, you know, if you've got a
hill or valley and there's a

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:28.360
cart on wheels, it's going
to go down to the bottom.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.400
The spontaneous change
lowers the potential

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.720
energy in that case.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:50.720
So this is a simple condition
that's very familiar.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.470
Now, the reason this condition
always holds in ordinary

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.120
mechanics is because you're
never, in that case, concerned

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.230
with a huge statistical
population of particles where

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:06.810
the disorder among
them is an issue.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.820
We're not worrying then about
the fact that, well like in

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:16.050
the case of gas molecules
mixing, the macroscopic state

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.290
of the whole thing, all those
molecules, how many different

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.750
microscopic configurations
are there?

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.500
Remember, I mentioned then we'll
go further later on into

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.170
this, that entropy
can be related to

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.490
the extent of disorder.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:32.010
That is, how many different
possible configurations of all

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.830
those molecules there would
be for a particular state.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:40.320
The reason the entropy of the
mixed gases is the highest is

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.770
because that has the most
possible configurations.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:48.190
If you start segregating the
gases, there are fewer

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.410
possible configurations that
the whole system can be in

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.740
because you're forcing
a particular set of

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.220
circumstances.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.390
When you don't have to worry
about criteria like that,

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.860
ordinary, mechanical energy
rules supreme, and that's

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.860
dictating where equilibrium
lies.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.230
But of course, most chemical and
biological systems aren't

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.460
that simple precisely because
you have to worry about many

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:22.590
particles and their statistics
and the way they might order

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.340
or disorder.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:31.700
So, and of course, you know,
keeping entropy as a fixed

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.740
variable for a system like that
is extremely cumbersome.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.180
As soon as you allow anything to
mix, like you might if you

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.040
want to do any chemistry,
entropy changes.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:46.730
If you change the temperature
entropy changes and so on.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.850
So let's go on.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:26:01.590
Let's consider a few
other examples.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:07.910
Let's hang on for a little
while longer to a set of

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.810
conditions where we will
maintain constant entropy,

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:24.380
namely constant entropy
and pressure.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:33.250
So, the dS term is zero, but
the other two are not.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:46.830
So, du plus p dV is
less than zero.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:56.210
I can write this as d(u
+ pV) less than zero.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.600
Normally I couldn't do that
because this term would have p

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:04.320
dV plus V dp, but we've
specified the pressure is

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.180
constant, so the dp
part is zero.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.470
And this is a quantity
that you know, right?

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.320
What's u plus pV?

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.060
STUDENT: dH.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:28.200
PROFESSOR NELSON: dH less
than zero, criterion for

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:34.400
spontaneous change.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:44.560
In the case where S and
p are held constant.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:51.730
Now, once again, like I
illustrated for entropy, and I

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:58.090
could have done the same for
energy here, you know, if we

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:02.310
again look at a bunch of
different states, and look at

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:07.520
their enthalpy, well, like
before, they'll be invariably

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:21.230
lots of possible states.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.800
And now, what is this saying,
the equilibrium state is the

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.690
one with the lowest
possible enthalpy.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:32.110
In the case here, that I just
illustrated with the little

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.760
cart going down the valley,
would be exactly the same with

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.180
regular energy, the equilibrium
state is one of

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.590
lowest energy, right.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.770
And of course there are
lots of nearby states.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.830
The cart could be a little ways
up the hill, and in this

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.900
case, it's enthalpy, but again,
there would be lots of

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.030
accessible states.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.450
But if the system is in
equilibrium, none of those

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:58.930
states has lower enthalpy.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.870
It's already in the lowest
enthalpy state.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:06.840
That is the equilibrium state.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:15.190
OK, well, now, let's get
to the big ones.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:18.630
That is, in real life, the
variables that you'd normally

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.280
control aren't some combination
of entropy and

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.220
these variables, but really
their temperature, volume and

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.660
pressure, any couple of those,
might be what you'd really

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.770
have under experimental
control.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:30:04.250
So now let's go to them.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:22.540
Let's control T and V.
So, all right, so now

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.510
we're getting serious.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:29.660
All right, well, there's our
equilibrium criterion.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.700
We're still going back to it.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.860
It still holds.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.720
So we've now got the dV
part equal to zero.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:48.010
So what this says is that du
minus T dS is less than zero,

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:54.460
and we can combine those
to say d(u - TS)

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.640
is less than zero.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.720
And again, just like before, we
can do that although this

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.600
normally would say this has
T dS and also minus S dT.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.650
T is fixed.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.480
So that part is zero.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.890
So this is really the
equivalent of this.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:17.420
So when we did this here, we
conveniently found that that

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:22.080
quantity u plus pV is something
we know and love,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.085
and we're familiar with it.

00:31:23.085 --> 00:31:25.900
It's our enthalpy H. So we could
write that criterion as

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.740
dH less than zero.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:35.680
So here, let's combine these
to define a new quantity.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.650
It obviously has importance
because what it's going to say

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:42.830
is that that's the quantity that
defines equilibrium, that

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:47.320
tells us about equilibrium,
under the very important

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.810
practical constraints
of having fixed

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:52.400
temperature and volume.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.470
Realistically, the more
likely constraints

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.930
than either of those.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:08.550
So let's -- we'll go to a
brand new color, define

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:13.550
A as u minus TS.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:26.460
it's called the Helmholtz
free energy.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.610
OK, and then our criterion for
equilibrium under these

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:39.685
conditions is dA, V and T equal
to the temperature of

00:32:39.685 --> 00:32:47.760
the surroundings, is
less than zero.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:56.910
OK, and once again, you know
if we wanted to look at a

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:09.900
bunch of states that could be
accessed, well, we would find

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.480
lots of states near by,
in character to

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.260
the equilibrium state.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.810
The one that is at equilibrium,
there is only one

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.450
macroscopic state
at equilibrium.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:31.950
It has the lowest A.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.800
In some sense, that's one reason
to associate this as a

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:41.270
kind of energy, just like
mechanical energy u or

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:47.320
enthalpy H, it's the minimum
free energy state that is the

00:33:47.320 --> 00:34:02.320
equilibrium state under the
relevant conditions.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.440
Now, let's take the step
to the biggest set of

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.280
conditions of all.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.220
What is it when you run a
chemical reaction under

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:18.160
ordinary circumstances,
what's constant?

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:18.720
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.500
PROFESSOR NELSON:
A little louder.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.140
STUDENT: Pressure
and temperature.

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:21.820
PROFESSOR NELSON: Pressure
and temperature, right.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.930
You're running, you're shaking
a beaker up here at room

00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:27.820
temperature.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:49.950
So let's look at that
set of conditions.

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:51.580
All right, there it is.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.560
This is the condition for really
the lion's share of

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.360
chemistry, biology, and other
kinds of changes we'll be

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.370
concerned with.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:07.730
So, there's our condition
for equilibrium.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.550
We don't get to set any of
them to zero, right?

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:21.640
So, okay and we can handle that.
du plus p dV minus T dS

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:28.080
is less than zero, but we do
get to simplify in writing

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:36.110
this as d(u + pV - TS) is less
than zero, and just like we've

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:41.840
seen before, yes, this has p
dV and V dp, but the dp is

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.750
zero because we're at
constant pressure.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:49.160
This has minus T dS minus S dT,
but the dT part is zero

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.380
because we're at constant
temperature.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.360
So the result is we can combine
all of these as a

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:59.240
single differential, and just
like we've seen before, what

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:04.490
that suggests is that we define
another new quantity

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.430
given by this expression.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:13.100
And that is the last one we're
going to describe.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:21.010
And that is G, u plus
pV minus TS.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:34.220
The Gibbs free energy.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:38.020
Notice, we could also write,
let's rewrite that.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:47.270
G is u plus the pV minus TS, but
u plus pV is H. So we also

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:54.050
can write this as H minus TS and
u minus TS is what we just

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:57.200
defined a minute ago as A.
So we can also write

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.710
this as A plus pV.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.800
And the main thing of crucial
importance is what, by

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.540
defining this in the way we
have, what that's saying is

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:37.320
that dG at constant p and
T is less than zero.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:49.390
There's our condition for
equilibrium at constant

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:56.480
temperature and pressure.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.830
Boy, is that going to be
important for the whole rest

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.990
of the course.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:14.400
So, and of course, I hardly need
to emphasize further, but

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.790
we could do the exact same
consideration that we have for

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:28.020
H and A, there's G. There's
our equilibrium state.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:34.640
It's the state that has the
lowest Gibbs free energy.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.050
All these things though
are incredibly

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:40.780
practical, useful criteria.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:47.670
This is only defined in terms
of state functions.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.070
And just like we saw before for
the case of entropy in an

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:56.900
isolated system, now we have
something we can calculate.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.340
It's a state function, so we're
at constant temperature

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.770
and pressure, and now we want
to consider some chemical

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:08.500
change or a phase transition
or you name it.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.740
Does it happen of
its own accord?

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.630
Well now we know what needs to
be calculated in order to

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.550
determine that.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:23.410
So this one is so uniquely
pervasive, let's just really

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:28.060
explicitly write it all out.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:39.550
For constant pressure and
temperature delta G is less

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:50.960
than zero, means A going to B
is, all right, let's consider

00:39:50.960 --> 00:40:02.450
some process state A and state
B. If delta G is less than

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:09.130
zero, it happens
spontaneously.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:29.480
If delta G equals zero, then
we're already in equilibrium.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:37.430
And if delta G is greater
than zero, then it goes

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:49.000
spontaneously in the
other direction.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.370
Any questions about
any of this?

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:58.860
Let me just give a couple
of examples.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.520
If we go back to any of those
chemical reactions that I

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:07.180
wrote on the board before,
right, well certainly we can

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:11.850
calculate what delta G would
be for each one of them.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:15.120
Because we know how to calculate
all the parts of it.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.010
It's state functions, it's
composed of state functions

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.270
that we know how to calculate.

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.570
So we could tell.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:28.200
When delta G is zero, you know,
it doesn't mean that

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.310
you've got all of one side,
all reactants and zero

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:36.290
products or all products
and zero reactants.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.130
There is some mixture of them.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:44.440
What this will tell us
is what mixture.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.900
You know the stuff is in there
in equilibrium, you know the

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.430
hydrogen and nitrogen that
will form ammonia.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.840
And in the end, when it's at
equilibrium, and you look and

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.740
you'd make a measurement,
right, you could do

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:56.560
spectroscopy.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.180
You could easily see how much
of each thing is there.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:05.570
It doesn't go all the way to
absolutely 100 percent

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:09.260
ammonia, zero hydrogen zero
nitrogen if they were mixed

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.660
together with the
right ratios.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.720
Doesn't happen.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.280
There would be some
of the reactants

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.790
and some of the products.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.840
In the biochemical reactions
that are taking place in your

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:26.680
body, there is equilibrium
between a whole myriad of

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.510
reactants and products, and
thank heavens that gets

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:33.700
maintained.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.750
So that's what this will guide
us through, and of course

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:42.170
that's incredibly, incredibly
important.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.880
Here's another thing that's
worth thinking about.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:54.430
There's a balance here between
ordinary energy or enthalpy

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:58.120
and entropy.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:02.130
Energy means, you know, chemical
reactions happen, and

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:06.330
you end up with something that
might be exothermic, that is,

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.940
the products are more stable
then the reactants.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:14.070
You burn methane, and it
combines with oxygen to form

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:19.070
water, to form CO2.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.910
And if you work out the
energetics as we've gone with

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:26.580
thermochemistry, you discover
there's a huge negative delta

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:30.320
H. In other words, the bonds
are much stronger.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.450
CO2 is really a stable
molecule.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:37.280
Methane, there are certainly
some solid bonds there, but

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:43.690
breaking those to form CO2 and
water, well it's worth it,

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:45.440
right, energetically.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:54.280
Still, the actual equilibrium
depends on entropy also, not

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.330
only on the energy.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.910
And that's why, when I put
up those three different

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:02.860
reactions, and we saw the
signs could vary.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.370
It's because there's a balance
between the two.

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:09.650
Energy may be favoring reaction
in one direction,

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:13.480
toward let's say products
that have lower energy.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.080
But at the same time, entropy
is going to be favoring

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.020
whichever side has higher
entropy, has more disorder,

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:26.810
and there's a balance
that's achieved.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:30.510
And that's why all those
reactions, first of all, in

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:34.400
some sense what I put up was
kind of a trivial statement in

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:39.630
actual fact saying they all
happen spontaneously, because

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:43.630
I didn't specify what we were
starting with exactly, what

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.410
concentrations we were
starting with.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:47.890
Even something quite unfavorable
might happen at

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:49.540
least a little bit
spontaneously.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.150
You'll have equilibrium.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:53.980
In those cases, though, you'd
have quite a reasonable

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.550
equilibrium, spontaneously, that
is there would be a lot

00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:00.060
of reaction that went if you
simply started under practical

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.390
conditions and let it go.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:06.820
Even though the signs of the
enthalpy changed, and the

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:10.430
signs of the entropy changed
because it's a combination of

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:11.990
the two that matters.

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:14.840
Here's a really simple
example.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:19.440
Mixing of oil and water.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.230
You know from experience if
you've ever mixed them to make

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.740
salad dressing, they
don't mix too well.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.850
And you may know that
if you heat them up,

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:33.930
they mix much better.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.550
Why?

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:39.550
You know, we've done a bunch of
thermochemistry, and we've

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:44.050
kind of seen that the energy
of mixing, your energetics

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:48.890
don't change too much as a
function of temperature.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:49.820
What's changing?

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:56.250
Why does it mix better
when you warm it up?

00:45:56.250 --> 00:46:00.150
But, you know, looking at our
definition of Gibbs free

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:09.070
energy, here it is,
right, or here.

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:13.500
Let me just say, actually if you
calculated delta S for the

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:17.450
mixing as a function of
temperature, it doesn't change

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:18.500
all that much.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:21.180
You know, the amount of disorder
upon mixing is not

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.860
really sensitive
to temperature.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:27.320
What does change though?

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:33.500
T, and the entropy is weighted
by the temperature, so the

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:38.850
entropy matters more and more
the hotter it gets.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:40.480
And that's consistent
with other things

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.650
that we've seen, right?

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:44.400
Remember the whole thing about
the perfect crystal at zero

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.490
degrees Kelvin has
zero entropy.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:49.610
It's completely ordered.

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.150
Entropy doesn't matter
anymore.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:55.580
It'll go to the lowest
energy state.

00:46:55.580 --> 00:47:03.660
Raise the temperature, and now
entropy plays a bigger role.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.990
So the point is, this balance
between energy that you could

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:12.190
think of as say bond energies
in chemical reactions, and

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:15.420
entropy that you can think of in
terms of disorder, how many

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.700
different possible combinations
or configurations

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.290
of something wrong,
will dictate where

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.830
the equilibrium lies.

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.630
And knowing now how to calculate
these free energies

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:29.580
especially the Helmholtz and
the Gibbs free energies,

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.760
that's what's going to guide
us in really calculating

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.750
quantitatively, OK, where
will equilibrium lie.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:42.490
And before long, we'll start
in on discussing chemical

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:46.810
equilibrium, does deriving
where they lie phase

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:47.490
equilibrium?

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:50.570
Does stuff change phase to go
from liquid to solid and so

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:51.620
forth, right?

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.960
And where does that happen, at
what temperature and pressure

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.530
and so forth.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:01.590
And it's always going to come
down to calculating the

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:05.900
appropriate free energy, and how
it changes in the process.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.230
So this is going to be a guide
for us for essentially all

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:11.760
that we're going to do in
the rest of the term.
