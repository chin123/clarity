00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.600
PROFESSOR: Let's do a one minute
review, and then move

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.940
onto the Clausius-Clapeyron
equation and see how far we

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.250
can go on that.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.390
So, reminding you then, what
you learned last time about

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:42.860
phase transitions is, you drew a
phase diagram in temperature

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.600
pressure space here.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.910
And then you had a triple point
somewhere, which was a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.830
unique point.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.590
The triple point temperature,
triple point pressure.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:05.200
Then there was a gas, solid,
call it coexistence line.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.510
Which kept on going
ad infinitum.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.080
And the a gas liquid
coexistent line.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.450
With a critical point.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.000
So that allowed you
to go around.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.860
You wanted to go from liquid to
gas, you could actually go

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.850
around this critical point, and
never actually see a phase

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.060
transition.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.040
Then there was a solid liquid
coexistence line.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.920
Which usually has a negative
slope, except for the two most

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.230
important substances on Earth,
which are water and silicon.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:56.580
So for water and silicon,
we have positive slope.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.650
H2O and silicon.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.930
This is why there's
life on Earth.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.740
Did you hear the story of why
there's life on Earth?

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.350
This is the secret of life.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.040
Without this, this is
why we're here.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.000
Because of this property.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.290
So, the reason why these slopes
come from the, so I'll

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.250
tell you the secret of life.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:42.040
But first let me remind you what
the coexistence curve is.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.890
dp/dT.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:52.000
Coexistence is delta S over
delta V, or delta H over T

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.640
delta V. And that's the
Clapeyron equation.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.190
Now, the slope of the curves
points us by, look at this

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.030
solid liquid line, delta
S, for solid liquid.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.790
I looked at it up here.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.710
It's going to be S liquid
minus S solid.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.810
And you know that's greater than
zero because the entropy

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.890
in the liquid state is much
bigger than it is

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.990
in the solid state.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.690
You have a crystal, entropy's
very small.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.060
Liquid state, much
more disorder.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.200
Got a positive sign here.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.360
Yes.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.740
Questions?

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:40.320
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.310
PROFESSOR: So, this is
almost everything.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.880
It has this slope here.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.060
Which is a negative slope.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.890
And water has a positive slope.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.170
Right?

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.380
Is that wrong?

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.990
It's wrong.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.900
Let's go through the argument.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.460
All right.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.420
All right.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.230
Let's go through the argument.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:18.250
So, then you have delta V, and
delta V is V solid minus V

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.360
liquid, this is per mole.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.790
Now, almost every
substance has V

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.070
solid less than V liquid.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.660
So this is negative.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.410
So almost every substance, you
have delta S divided by delta

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.120
V is negative.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.850
A negative slope.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:42.630
You're right.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.650
So I have it backwards.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.230
I do have it backwards.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.750
OK.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.135
See, I was really trying
to make it so that

00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:53.070
my drawing was right.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.310
Which is why I inverted the
solid and liquid here.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.580
So I really wanted to
be right, but I

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.850
ended up being wrong.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.180
Liquid is less than solid.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.210
Well this is water.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.069
Why do I have it backwards
in my notes.

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:17.330
I've got to correct that.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.510
So this is most substances,
is positive.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:30.750
OK so, and most substances,
OK?

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.360
Except for water and silicon.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.520
Because for water and silicon
this is reversed.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.670
Because the molar volume of
solid for water is bigger than

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.210
that for liquid.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.550
So this is bigger than here.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.356
Thank you.

00:05:47.356 --> 00:05:47.760
OK.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.500
Thanks for catching it.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.040
OK, so what happens if the molar
volume for the liquid is

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.470
bigger than the molar
volume of the solid.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.740
The density of water which is
the inverse of the mole

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.270
volume, so the density, the
molar density, is equal to one

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.060
over the molar volume.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.710
So you've got the molar density
for liquid is then

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.980
smaller than the molar density
for the solid.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.640
It's one over, right?

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.510
So that's why ice floats.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.710
Because it's less dense
than liquid water.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.540
So what do you think would
happen in the winter if ice

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.320
didn't float, in the
Charles River.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.660
It would go to the bottom.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.240
It would freeze, solid and
you would have no fish.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.140
You would have no life.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.560
It would freeze solid and that
would be the end of life.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.010
And you know, five hundred
million years ago there would

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.910
be no fish.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.210
There would be no dinosaurs.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.750
There would be no anything,
there would be no humans.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.810
That's the secret of life.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:02.280
And the fact that this is also
the case is very useful for

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.470
making silicon.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.700
For processing silicon.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.750
Another the secret of life.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.710
Where would we be
without silicon?

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.550
Our civilization would be, we'd
still be using stones and

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.190
things, right?

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:25.310
OK, so it's super
super important.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.280
Alright, so this is
a Clapeyron story.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.720
Which we ended up
getting right.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.090
Even though I insisted
on getting it wrong.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.910
So what happens now is Mr.
Clausius came around and he

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.360
realized that you can make some
approximations that are

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.760
very useful.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.380
So the first approximation is,
you can realize that the molar

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.260
volume of the gas is always much
bigger than the volume of

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.620
the solid or the liquid.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.250
And so as a result whenever you
have these delta V's, for

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:15.460
sublimation, or delta V for
vaporization, which is the

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.230
volume the gas minus the
volume of the solid.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.790
Or the volume of the gas minus
the volume of the liquid, you

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.120
might as well ignore
the volume of the

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.490
liquid or of the solid.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.740
And this can just be equal to
roughly the volume of the gas.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.090
So this is the first
approximation he made.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.445
So now, if you go back to the
to the Clapeyron equation up

00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:39.710
here, with this approximation
then dp/dT, the coexistence

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:48.070
line, is delta H divided
by T V gas.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.480
For sublimation.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.700
Or vaporization.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.400
You don't have the delta
V down there any more.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.180
Then the next thing that, next
assumption that he realized

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.920
you can make was, well, all
these gases could, they're

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.910
like ideal gases.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.515
So we can, instead of having the
volume of the gas here, we

00:09:10.515 --> 00:09:11.960
can use the ideal gas law.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.350
This is all, let's do
all this per mole.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:21.360
So V is equal to RT over p.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.400
You can plug this
back in here.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.150
And then you end up with the
Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.600
So this is approximation now.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.610
We put in RT over p for here.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:39.550
We have p delta H, where this
is either sublimation or

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:51.700
vaporization divided by RT
squared. dp/dT, sublimation or

00:09:51.700 --> 00:10:00.930
vaporization, and this is the
Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.250
Two important approximations
that go in here.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.650
And it's not valid for
solids or liquid.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.310
You have to have a gas in there
because of the ideal gas

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:17.370
for the approximation
that goes in here.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.020
And once you have that, you
can integrate both sides.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.620
You've got to put the
temperatures on one side.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.140
Put the pressures on
the other side.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.190
I'll go ahead and cover
this up here.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:38.900
So you have one over
p dp/dT is equal to

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.070
delta H over RT squared.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:47.540
One over p dp/dT that's
just like d log p.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.200
And that's another form that
you're going to see often for

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.760
the Clausius-Clapeyron
approximation is d log p / dT

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.930
is equal to delta H
over RT squared.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.110
And I'm freely dropping the
sublimation and the

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.350
vaporization because we know
that's what I mean here.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.420
It's only valid for
those two lines.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.490
So that's another form
that you'll see.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:16.710
And that's not dT here, that's
d log p, d log p dp.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.330
Yeah, that's right,
d log p / dT.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.620
And so now you can take
the dT to the

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.510
other side and integrate.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.970
From point one to point two d
log p, is from point one to

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:37.720
point two, delta H over
RT squared dT.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.290
And you make the usual
approximation, which we've

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.570
made before.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:47.620
That delta H is roughly
independent of temperature, or

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.200
very slowly changing
with temperature.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.670
And that's fine as long
as you're in a

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.290
narrow temperature range.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.720
Which is usually the case
when you have these

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.770
Clausius-Clapeyron equation
problems.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.425
So you can take the delta H out
of the integral, the R out

00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:01.900
of the integral.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.760
And you can integrate
both sides.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:16.720
To give you log p2 minus log
p1, is delta H times R,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:26.560
divided by R, delta H divided by
R. Delta H over R times T2

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.250
minus T1 over T1 T2.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.900
It looks a lot like and the
temperature dependence

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.910
equilibrium constant.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.080
And in fact, but it's
not, right?

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.320
And some people use that
equation here instead of

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.190
equilibrium constant.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.880
Temperature dependence.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.460
That's, can give rise
to problems.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.940
Because obviously they're
not the same equation.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:56.690
But roughly has the same form.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:01.980
So, another way that you'll also
find this written is very

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.770
often p1 and T1 will
be some reference.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.890
Pressures and temperature,
maybe one bar, let's say.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.600
T1, 298 degrees Kelvin.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.640
That's your reference point and
you want to find out the

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:21.000
pressure temperature dependence
in an equation.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.410
So if you rearrange your
equations so p1, T1 are now

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.370
some reference point.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.140
They become numbers.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.480
So you have log of a reference
point, T1 here is a number.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:36.400
So you often see this equation
rewritten then as log p is

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:43.080
equal to delta H over RT.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.360
And I feel like I've got a minus
sign missing somewhere.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.030
Here.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.420
Oh yeah, when you integrate
this, the one over T squared,

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.210
there's a minus sign.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.460
Oh, I took care of that by
doing T2 minus T1 here.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.310
I think there's still a minus
sign problem somewhere.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.420
I think there's a minus
sign problem.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:06.150
Let me check up the
notes here.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.830
Minus one over T1 minus
T2 over T1 T2.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:27.030
Where's my minus sign?

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.430
T2 minus T1.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:49.000
OK, so I got minus T1,
minus T2 over T1 T2.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.900
T2 minus T1.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.170
This is fine, right.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.000
There's no minus sign problem.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.540
Plus a constant.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:08.030
OK, so you'll often see
it written like that.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.160
And that gives you a
relationship between the

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.160
pressure and the temperature
then, for a substance where

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.425
all the reference point
information is contained in

00:15:20.425 --> 00:15:24.220
this constant, C. Which
is where the T1's and

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.530
the p's come from.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.690
OK, any questions?

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:39.940
We'll do a little example here
of how this could be used.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.440
So let's switch to
an example now.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.910
Let's go to the example, let's
first do the example which is

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:53.750
at the very end of the notes.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:16:00.960
So this is an example of RDX.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:08.780
RDX is a famous explosive,
as I'm sure you know.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:14.820
And it's plastic explosive.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.440
It's got a melting point
of 204 degrees Celsius.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.340
481 degrees Kelvin.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:28.450
And it's a problem for, so it's
a very powerful explosive

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.620
and you can't see
it in X-rays.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.630
So it's a problem at airports.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.800
You've got be able to find if
somebody's carrying a little

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.210
piece of RDX in their luggage.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.930
And so, the question becomes
what do you need to

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.950
know to detect it?

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.010
You want to find the
vapor pressure.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.210
You've gotta have, and the
machine which basically is

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:53.520
sensitive enough to detect
molecules of RDX that are in

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.630
vapor at room temperature.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:02.230
So the way that you do that
is, you do an experiment.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.000
Where you measure the pressure,
the vapor pressure,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.180
as a function of temperature.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.980
And room temperature, it turns
out if it's not volatile at

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.900
all, if the vapor pressure
is very, really tiny.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.930
And so in order to get accurate
numbers, you actually

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.070
do your measurements at
significantly higher

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.970
temperatures than room
temperature.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.210
They do it close to the melting
point, so you're

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.150
actually looking at the
sublimation of RDX.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:33.170
You do it, let's say, at 400
degrees Kelvin, where the

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.890
melting point is at 481
degrees Kelvin.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.700
So slightly below the melting
point you're looking at

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.880
sublimation.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.610
And you plot.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:51.500
Log p versus one over
T. And according to

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.580
Clausius-Clapeyron,
that should give

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.890
you a straight line.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.820
And in fact, that's exactly what
you see when you take RDX

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.420
and do that experiment.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.530
You end up with a bunch
of data points.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:08.150
That's fall nicely on
this straight line.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.930
And then you can extrapolate
to room temperature.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.790
Somewhere here, let's say,
300 degrees Kelvin.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:21.250
And find out what log p is,
at 300 degrees Kelvin.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.700
And what you find is that, and
that's the graph that's on the

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.340
last page of the lecture notes,
that the vapor pressure

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:35.630
of RDX at room temperature is 10
to the minus 11 bar, That's

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.540
ten parts per trillion.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.970
So it tells you that if you
want to detect RDX with a

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.670
sniffer machine at the airport,
that machine better

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:49.980
be able to tell you, find one
molecule of RDX out of a tenth

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.310
of a trillion other molecules,
basically.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:58.550
Which is a really hard
thing to do.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.080
So this gives you a
design rule for

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.300
these pieces of equipment.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.190
And why they're so expensive.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:12.520
OK, before we do the next
example, let's see if any

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.670
questions on Clausius-Clapeyron.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:15.940
Yeah.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:27.000
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.190
PROFESSOR: So, p as some
exponential here?

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.010
You know, I don't recall
seeing it as

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:33.940
an exponential form.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.940
But that doesn't mean it's not
used the exponential form.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.250
This is an easy way to do it,
because then you've got a

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.850
linear relationship.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.940
And generally we like to
see straight lines.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:49.780
So this gives you a nice
straight line.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:57.800
OK, so now let's do a slightly
more complicated example.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:05.690
Which is, so most of the time
you don't have pure material.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.340
You have a mixture
of some sort.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.840
For instance, if I have a glass
of water on the table at

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.840
room temperature.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:22.510
Above the glass of water, I have
air, there's my H2O here.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.440
And then I've got some air.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.770
Above the glass of water.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.430
And the air's inert
to the water.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:29.630
It's not reacting
with the water.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:34.020
So it's like an inert gas
sitting on top of the water.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.130
Then I want to ask the question,
what is the vapor

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.730
pressure of the water?

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.220
In the presence of this
inert gas, the air.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.980
It's not really the same as the
problem that we've been

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.520
looking at up here.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.050
Right?

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.610
Because this gas liquid
coexistence line, this

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.860
diagram, and this Clapeyron
equation, is all done for a

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.140
pure substance.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.570
And at room temperature, at
room temperature, we're

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.130
sitting squarely in
the liquid phase.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.710
We're not on the coexistence
line.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:13.790
At room temperature and
one bar pressure.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.160
So instead of having this system
here, I looked at the

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.820
system where I had the water,
H2O, with nothing on top.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.150
With no air on top.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.300
Except the cylinder.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:31.500
Now, I'd better make the surface
of my water a straight

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.520
line, otherwise I'm going
to get in trouble.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.580
There's the water sitting
right here.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.980
And I put a cylinder with
one bar pressure on top.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.370
My cylinder's going to sit
squarely on the stump of the

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:46.670
surface of the water.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.640
This is not going to be any
water vapor at one bar

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.090
pressure on that cylinder.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.710
At one bar, we're way up
in the liquid phase.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:59.170
I would have to decrease the
pressure on that cylinder down

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:05.030
to, I don't know, whatever the
water vapor pressure is at

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.900
room temperature here on
this coexistence curve.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.700
0.1 bar or something.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.120
0.05 bar.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.400
Something pretty small.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.870
So that's what we've
been working on.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:17.620
This pure system.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.440
And now we're going to be
working on this system here,

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.610
where we have air.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.610
With a cylinder on
top, one bar.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:34.320
And we want to know what is the
vapor pressure of H2O in

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:40.400
this system here.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.780
Is it zero?

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.300
Anybody want to guess,
if it's zero?

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.050
We know there's vapor pressure
there, right?

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.630
And a good guess is that that
vapor pressure here, it's

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:00.000
pretty close to the pressure
that you would guess by using

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.050
this diagram with
the pure water.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.060
But the key word is,
it's pretty close.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:12.180
It's not exactly the same.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.450
So, let me ask you this.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:21.510
Without looking at the notes,
now is p H2O in this problem

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:31.100
here greater than, less than,
or the same as p H2O in the

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:37.340
pure Clapeyron case?

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.320
How many people think
that it's the same?

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.060
How about smaller than?

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.080
Smaller than?

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.680
Few people think that
it's smaller than.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.830
How about greater than?

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:54.440
A bunch of people don't
know what to answer.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.550
OK.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:58.590
I think that if you think about
it, what the difference

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:04.950
is between here and there, you
could probably reason which

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:06.030
way it should go.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:09.660
Which way the partial pressure
of the water should go under

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.700
one bar pressure, room
temperature.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.830
Compared to what you might
expect it to be at room

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.610
temperature with a diagram.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.390
So, I'm going to give you a
little bit of time just to

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:22.370
think about it.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.670
Without looking at the notes,
what you think the

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:25.650
right sign is here.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:33.280
Then we'll do the problem and
then we'll figure out if you

00:24:33.280 --> 00:25:08.210
were right or wrong.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.700
OK.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:14.140
How many people say
it's greater than?

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.360
One, two.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.610
Two brave people here.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.560
Two.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.350
How many people say
it's smaller than?

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.280
OK.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.500
Smaller than.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.640
So I'm going to say a
large number, OK?

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.720
Many.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.550
How many people think
it's equal?

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.710
One person thinks it's equal.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.890
Alright, let's do it out now
and see how it comes out.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:46.530
And then we can reason why it
came out the way it came out.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.270
Logically, without actually
doing math.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:51.590
Because there's a way to reason
it out that you should

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:57.540
be able to do.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.100
OK, so this is what
we have here.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:05.180
Then the system is, we
have this container.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.970
Let me redo it instead
of writing air.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.330
So we have the liquid
state here.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.600
Some substance, and it doesn't
have to be water.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.730
That's a liquid, at
some pressure p.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.550
And I'm going to say P capital,
that's going to be

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.980
the total pressure.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.550
And the total pressure is given
by the piston here. p

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.710
total, p T. And on top here
I'm going to have two

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.300
substances.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.500
I'm going to have A,
in the gas phase,

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.950
that's the water vapor.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.610
Some partial pressure, p sub
A, temperature T. And I'm

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:42.970
going to have the inert
gas, with some

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.070
partial pressure p, inert.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:49.270
Such that the sum of the partial
pressure of the inert

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:53.560
gas, plus the partial pressure
of A, is the total pressure.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.860
One bar, in our case.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.630
With the water with
the air on top.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.370
And the question, oh, let me
make a few more definitions.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:12.140
We're going to define p0 as
the vapor pressure of pure

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:16.110
vapor pressure of pure A. So
that's what you would read off

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.900
the diagram here.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:26.860
And what we want, the question
we ask is, what is the partial

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:34.730
pressure of A as a function
of the total pressure?

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.940
That's what we're asking.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.750
As I'm increasing the total
pressure, meaning I'm putting

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.580
more and more inert
gas in there,

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.440
which way is this going?

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.030
Is it going up, down,
or staying the same?

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.500
And we've got a bunch
of votes up here.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.120
Most people think that it's
going to go down.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.940
Because I put more
gas in there.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:28:03.080
OK, I know that if P, capital P,
is equal to pA, then pA is

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.130
equal to p0.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:05.640
Right?

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.210
There's no inert gas.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.100
So that's the one extreme
case here.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.460
There's no inert gas, then the
partial pressure's going to be

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.200
what you read off
that graph here.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.020
So another way of saying what is
p as a function of capital

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:23.300
P, is to ask the question
what is the slope?

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.590
I've got one point here.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.290
If I can integrate the slope
then I have this equation.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:35.210
So the other way to ask the
question is, what is dpA/dp,

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.720
at a constant temperature?

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.260
Where I'm keeping the
temperature constant.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:43.060
And that turns out to be
easier to calculate.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.740
These slopes are always easier
to calculate than

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:51.870
the absolute things.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.560
So we're doing an equilibrium
here.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.080
We have an equilibrium
between the liquid

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.870
state and the gas phase.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.180
And we want to know something
about this equilibrium as we

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.100
change a parameter.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.500
Equilibrium, what do we always
start with when we have an

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:03.770
equilibrium.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.240
What's the first thing
we think about?

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.280
We think about chemical
potential.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.560
Chemical potentials of A, in
the gas phase has to be the

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.660
same as the chemical potential
of A in the liquid phase.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.660
Well, I can't think of anything
else to start with.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.300
So let me start with that.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:24.990
So let's start by writing the
chemical potentials being

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.000
equal to each other.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.070
Because we know that's true.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:37.570
So mu A, in the gas phase,
temperature and with a partial

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:45.350
pressure p sub A. Is equal to
mu A in the liquid phase,

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:50.040
where the pressure on the
liquid is capital P.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.820
What else do we know?

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.130
Well, we, what else are
we going to need?

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:57.720
Before we do that, since what
we're after is the derivative,

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.320
let's take the derivative
of both sides.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.180
We're looking at a derivative
with respect to pressure here.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.130
Let's take the derivative
outside with pressure and see

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.600
what happens.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.246
So let's take the derivative
of this with

00:30:07.246 --> 00:30:08.220
respect to total pressure.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.860
Well, this isn't
total pressure.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.290
This is the partial pressure of
A. But it's a function of

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.250
the total pressure.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.350
It's a function of the
total pressure.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.690
Partial pressure of A is total
pressure minus p inert.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:24.630
So, we have to use
the chain rule.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:32.500
So on this side here, we
have d mu A / dpA.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:40.840
So I'm taking d/dp
of both sides.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.980
Then by chain rule, dpA/dP.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.660
Constant temperature.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:56.690
And then on the right-hand
side, I have d mu A / dP,

00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:00.210
constant temperature.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:05.930
Well, d mu / dP, that may or may
not seem familiar to you.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.550
I never remember these things,
but I always remember that

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.830
there's, that these
relationships are interesting.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.890
Especially when you're talking
about something like a

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.930
chemical potential, which is
really nothing but the Gibbs

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.780
free energy.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:22.060
With respect to pressure, when
we know that the variables

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.990
that we use for Gibbs free
energy are pressure and

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.930
temperature.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:25.540
Right?

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.000
So this is the variable that
goes with Gibbs free energy.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.902
So this means that they were
taking the derivatives of the

00:31:31.902 --> 00:31:34.280
Gibbs free energy with respect
to one of its variables is

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.010
something that we should know.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.200
So we go back to writing what
the Gibbs free energy is.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:44.850
So dG is equal to
V dp minus S dT.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:46.670
Which is the fundamental
equation

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.170
for Gibbs free energy.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.310
And this is the Gibbs free
energy per mole.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:53.730
That's just the chemical
potential.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.360
The same thing.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.950
And this is the derivative
with respect to pressure.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.380
And this is the derivative with
respect to temperature.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.890
So this thing here
is d mu / dp.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.250
At constant temperature.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:09.570
It's just the volume.

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.300
So now we have this equation,
where we started out with the

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:12.980
chemical potentials.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.490
And we've got these d
mu A / dpA, we've

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.310
got d mu A / dP here.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:22.160
That's just the molar
volume of the gas.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.790
Right, because this is mu
of the gas phase here.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.550
So this is the molar
volume of the gas.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.310
And I have dpa/dP.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.510
And, this is very nice.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.790
Because this is actually
what I'm trying to get.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.900
Trying to see how the partial
pressure of a changes with the

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:38.490
total pressure.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.730
That's what I'm trying
to calculate here.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:42.630
I know what this is.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:45.590
This is just an experimental
number.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.790
And then on this side here
I have d mu A / dP.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.720
This is the liquid phase.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.350
Derivative with respect to total
pressure, that's the

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:57.460
molar volume of the liquid.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.200
The liquid.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:08.920
Great, I'm done. dpA/dP total,
constant pressure, is the

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:14.350
ratio of the molar volume of the
liquid of A divided by the

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:17.970
molar volume of the gas.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:21.590
What's the sign?

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.130
Volumes are positive, right?

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.060
This has to be positive.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.370
There's no choice.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.200
It can't even be zero.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.970
It has to be positive, right?

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:36.470
So that means the slope
is a positive slope.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:44.770
As I increase the total
pressure, p is going to go up.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:49.680
If I integrate now, this,
starting at, so the total

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.490
pressure is equal to pA, I'm
going to get a curve that

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:58.610
looks like this.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.410
OK, if I write on this axis p
inert, so when p inert is

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:05.180
equal to zero, total
pressure is pA.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.550
I'm going to start at p0.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:11.700
And I'm going to go up from
there, positive slope.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.400
So.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.790
Who was right?

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:17.910
A couple people are right.

00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:20.340
So let's think about it
in a different way.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.750
Let's think about it
in a different way.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.260
So we did the math, and we found
that actually it's, and

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.590
that turns out to be a
very small amount.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:32.960
You do a very good job by just
taking this curve here.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.180
And using the pure substance.

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:37.880
In fact, in the notes we have
an example of how much it

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.390
changes for mercury.

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:45.630
So for mercury, at 100 degrees
C, for pure mercury, the vapor

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.730
pressure is 0.27 bar.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:53.170
If you add enough inert gas to
make it 1 bar for the total

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.720
pressure, you go from
0.27 to 0.2701.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.680
Not much of a change.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.680
They do a really good job
of just picking this.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.300
And if you go to 100 bar, then
you increase it to 0.28.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.130
So it takes a lot of pressure
on top, a lot of extra inert

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:10.550
gas to really make much
of a difference.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:13.470
But, let's think about
why it would make a

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:19.180
difference, just logically.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.310
So in the absence of this inert
gas here, I just have

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.420
the pure substance.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:30.980
I add some inert gas, what
happens to the entropy on top?

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.660
It's increasing, right?

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:36.790
Do systems like to have
more entropy?

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.630
Yeah.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:43.520
So, I have a lot of
inert gas here.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.460
A small amount of A. What if I
had a little bit more A, in

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.510
the presence of the inert gas?

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:54.050
Which way would the
entropy go?

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:55.060
It would go up a little
bit more,

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.040
you'd have more disorder.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.370
If I have nothing, if I have
no A here, up here and just

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.020
the inert gas, then there's
no entropy of mixing.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.615
I add a little bit of inert gas,
there's a little bit more

00:36:04.615 --> 00:36:05.720
entropy of mixing.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.890
Eventually, I add more and more,
entropy of mixing goes

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.330
up and up and up, and eventually
it comes back down

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.150
to where I have pure A on top.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:21.960
So the entropy of mixing up here
is driving the increase

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:27.090
in the pressure of, in the
partial pressure of A. Entropy

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.120
is this amazingly
important term.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:29.750
That's what we saw.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:33.710
Entropy of mixing was
responsible for equilibrium.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.310
Without entropy of mixing,
then everything would go

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:37.610
directly to the products.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.630
You'd never have
an equilibrium.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:43.290
Another secret of life.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.870
So entropy of mixing here is
driving this positive slope.

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.400
That's another way of
thinking about it.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.660
And that's why you can guess
ahead of time what the signs

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.540
of these things ought to be.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:58.320
Without doing the math.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:06.450
Alright, any questions?

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:06.930
OK.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:14.130
So there's another sample
problem with the notes, which

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.100
is sort of like a standard
problem.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:25.300
Where you're given a
Clausius-Clapeyron equation

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.640
for a substance in this form.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:39.200
So if you look at it, log p is
minus some energy divided by

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.080
RT plus some number.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.290
In this case, it's negative,
the delta H is negative for

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.210
the substance that
you have there.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.640
And you're given it for the
liquid phase, for the vapor

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.100
pressure above the liquid
and the vapor

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.200
pressure above the solid.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.510
You can, because the only way
it doesn't work is if you're

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.250
looking at solid liquid.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:02.130
So, and then you're asked to
manipulate this equation to

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.120
find different properties.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.480
For instance the triple point.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.670
It's a very common
thing to get, the

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:10.530
triple point from this.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.800
The delta H, it's a way to get
delta H. Just like we saw for

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.910
the RDX, right?

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.690
The data points formed
a straight line.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:20.860
And the slope gave you
delta H, for RDX.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.240
Delta H of sublimation
for RDX.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:27.040
So this is the way that this
equation is used for problems.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.110
I'm not going to do
this problem.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.020
Instead I'm going to
go ahead and forge

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.590
ahead to the next topic.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.520
And start it.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:41.200
This is the topic we're going
to do it after spring break.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:48.610
And and it really is a topic
that follows this pretty

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:49.890
straightforwardly.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.900
Well, it's more complicated,
but it's similar to this

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.890
problem here.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:59.340
So we saw that in real
life yes, question?

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:06.100
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.110
PROFESSOR: The exam.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:08.770
Oh there's an exam is,
which is, oh I

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:13.120
forgot about the exam.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:13.610
So let's see.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.150
There's a problem set
that's due today.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:19.530
The exam will be up to the
problem set that's due today.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:23.430
Which means that what I talked
about today is not going to be

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.060
on the exam.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:30.800
Because it's not covered
in the problem set.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.150
So let's say it goes up to
Wednesday's lecture.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:36.970
Which means you might still
have a phase transition

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:42.170
problem, right?

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.270
In fact, you're very
likely to get a

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.040
phase transition problem.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.890
It's very likely
to be the case.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:53.070
Because it's an easy problem
to put together.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.590
But you don't have to worry
about Clausius-Clapeyron.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.840
You do have to worry about
Clapeyron, but not

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:03.000
Clausius-Clapeyron, OK?

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.400
So, for the exam, we're going to
put on the Web last year's

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.970
exam, and you guys are
going to do reviews.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.070
The usual thing.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:13.340
Yeah?

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:17.470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:18.850
PROFESSOR: So that you don't
see the answers.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.620
Yeah, absolutely this
can easily be done.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.690
We'll do that.

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:30.800
Any other questions,
about the exam?

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.490
Now, I don't remember.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.900
Is there a problem set that, so
I'm not assigning a problem

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.530
set today, right, then?

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:35.840
Right.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.120
OK.

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:40.510
Good.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.840
Because I hadn't loaded
it up yet.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:45.300
And so now I won't load it up.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.630
OK.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.200
Anything else?

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.620
OK, so let me tell you where
we're going to go

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.110
then, after the break.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:54.810
So after the break, we're going
to be starting to talk

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:58.260
about things that are called
colligative properties.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:03.390
Colligative properties are the
properties like the vapor

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:08.650
pressure, lowering when you have
a mixture in a liquid,

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.920
instead of having a pure
substance you have a mixture

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.730
of substances here.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:16.440
And then the vapor
pressure of both

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:20.060
substances above gets lowered.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.140
Anybody want to guess why
they got lowered?

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.990
What's the magic word?

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.580
Entropy of mixing, right.

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.440
Right.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.350
There's more entropy of mixing
if you've got a mixture in the

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:32.790
liquid than if you have
a pure gas up there.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.540
So usually, so let me back up.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:39.760
Usually it's when you have a
solute, like salt in water.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.390
Where water is volatile
and the salt is not.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.720
Right, a salt in water solution
will have a lower

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:50.450
vapor pressure than a solution
of pure water.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.740
Because of the entropy
of mixing in a

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.350
salt and water solution.

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:57.780
The salt and water solution
we have a lowering,

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.590
lower melting point.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.470
And that's significantly
lower.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.510
Which is why we use it
on roads, right?

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.010
That's a colligative
properties.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.120
Osmotic pressure.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.840
Which you've already sort
of heard about.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:13.320
Why saltwater fish are unhappy
in fresh water.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.550
That's a colligative property.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.660
So we're going to go through
these colligative properties.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.000
And the mainstay of these
colligative properties is that

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.360
we're going to be talking
about mixtures

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.520
in the liquid phase.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.510
Here we talked about a mixture
in the gas phase, changing

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.600
some property.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.070
From now on, we're going to be
talking about mixtures in the

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.380
liquid phase, pretty much.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.510
And so our goal is going to
be able to, is going to be

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:42.000
predict the way that properties
change as you have

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.530
these mixtures.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:52.220
OK. so the standard mixture that
we're going to have, is

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:57.400
to have a binary liquid
gas mixture.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.160
So that means we're going
to have two substances.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.340
A and B. And at first, we're
going to make it

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.010
as general as possible.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:08.563
So we're going to have liquid
phase of A, the liquid phase

00:43:08.563 --> 00:43:12.810
of B. So, for instance, this
could be vodka, right?

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:15.100
Water and ethanol.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.380
And water and ethanol
are both volatile.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:25.580
So we're going to have water and
ethanol in the gas phase.

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.160
There, and it's a mixture,
they're perfectly miscible in

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.210
the liquid phase, A and B. And
there's going to be some

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.380
fraction, molar fraction,
of these things.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.400
We're going to have a molar
fraction in the liquid phase

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.320
for A and B. And some molar
fraction in the gas phase, for

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.340
A and B. We're going to call it
yA and yB, that's the molar

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.190
fraction in the gas phase.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:50.465
And there's no reason why the
molar fractions in the gas

00:43:50.465 --> 00:43:54.810
phrase should be the same as
that in the liquid phase.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:55.410
And we know that.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:57.825
We know that ethanol is more
volatile than water.

00:43:57.825 --> 00:44:02.260
And so if you have a gas of
vodka, then you can smell the

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.430
alcohol because it's
coming out.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.750
But the water is, vapor
pressure is,

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:09.830
very slow, very small.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:11.190
It's the usual, it's
pretty close to

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.310
the usual vapor pressure.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:17.410
And our question is, what we're
going to be asking is,

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:20.260
how many, if I give you the
total pressure and the

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.960
temperature here, what else do I
need to know to find out all

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.940
these molar fractions?

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.140
So let's first see what all the

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:31.240
variables are that we have.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.650
Usually, we have
two variables.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.390
The temperature and pressure,
and that's enough to tell us

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:35.820
everything.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.550
But here now we have
a mixture.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.380
So we're going to need
more than that.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:41.620
We're going to need
four variables.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.820
We're going to need
the temperature.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:48.090
The pressure, and we're going to
need the molar fraction of

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.770
A in the liquid phase.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.750
And the molar fraction of
A in the gas phase.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:55.160
We're not going to need
any more than that.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.320
Actually we're going to
need less than that.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:59.100
But those are the four variables
that we can easily

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.370
identify here.

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:05.470
And we don't need yB and xB,
because the sum of the molar

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:13.800
fraction has to be equal to one.
yB is one minus yA, xB is

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.650
one minus xA.

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:17.440
So we don't need y.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.120
So these are a priori the
independent variables that we

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.270
have to work with.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:26.380
Now, we have some constraints
here.

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.280
We have a constraint.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.970
Our constraint is that we are
the coexistence point.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:35.210
There's a coexistence between
the gas phase

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.170
and the liquid phase.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:44.400
And what does it mean for A
liquid to be coexistent with A

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.980
in the gas phase?

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:47.940
Chemical potential.

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.160
The chemical potential of a
molecule of A in the liquid

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.266
phase here is the same as the
chemical potential of

00:45:52.266 --> 00:45:52.670
A in the gas phase.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:53.830
So we have two constraints.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:46:00.330
We have mu A for the liquid
phase is equal to mu A for the

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:06.330
gas phase, and mu B for the
liquid phase equal to mu B for

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:06.520
the gas phase.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.650
So we have four variables,
two constraints.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:13.180
That means that the total
number of independent

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.850
variables we have is just two.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.740
It's the number of variables
four, minus the constraints.

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:19.740
OK?

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.850
Or you could say six variables
if you include yB and xB, and

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:24.110
four constraints.

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:26.700
Whatever we accounted,
you just have

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.660
two degrees of freedom.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:37.530
So we have two degrees
of freedom.

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:43.290
Which means that if you know the
temperature and pressure,

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.840
then you still know
everything.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.670
At the coexistence point.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:51.370
You still know what the molar
fraction is of your two

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:53.220
substances in both phases.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:57.050
So that's really powerful.

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:01.690
Or if you know just the molar
fraction of A, and the

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:03.940
temperature, then you know
the pressure above.

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.690
And you know everything else.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:09.490
So in this very complicated
mixture here, you still only

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:11.460
need to know a couple of things
to tell you everything

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:16.240
about this mixture.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:22.750
And this example here is a
specific example of something

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:24.370
called the Gibbs phase rule.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:27.580
Which you've seen before.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.980
In this diagram.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:33.880
In this diagram that
we wrote here.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.780
Where, let me write down what
the Gibbs phase rule is first.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.410
The Gibbs phase rule tells you
the number of independent

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.710
variables given a number
of constraints.

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:56.930
So, it tells you that the number
of degrees of freedom,

00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:59.290
the number of independent
variables in a mixture, in a

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:03.140
complicated system like this,
is equal to C, which is the

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.050
number of components.

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:09.470
So in this case, it would
be two components.

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.500
You have A and B. The components
is the number of

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.910
independent species that
you have, minus

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.120
the number of phases.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.780
So here we have two phases, the
gas phase and the water

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:24.800
phase, plus two.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:29.340
So for this example here, then
we would have two components,

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.680
C equals two.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.480
Two phases liquid and gas.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:33.930
A and B are the components.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:34.950
And then plus two.

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:40.220
So two minus two plus two,
F equals to two.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:45.400
Two degrees of freedom, two
independent variables.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.750
If I'm looking at this diagram
here, in this diagram here I

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:52.210
have C equals one.

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:54.740
One component, right?

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:59.560
If I'm sitting where there's
only one phase, say, the

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:04.930
liquid phase or the gas phase,
then p equals one.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:08.190
Then F is one minus one plus
two, is equal to two.

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:09.620
Two degrees of freedom.

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.800
And so in the pure phase,
I am in a plane.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.610
The pressure and the temperature
are my two degrees

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:15.190
of freedom.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.430
I can freely move around
the plane.

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:20.370
At a coexistence line,
then the number of

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:25.130
phases equals to two.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:30.540
Then I have one minus two is
minus one, plus two is one.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.350
The degrees of freedom is one.

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:34.580
That's a line.

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.520
I have one degree of freedom.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.750
I can move in the line, in
the line in a plane.

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:41.130
Then if I change to the triple
point, where the number of

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:45.510
phases is three, then the number
of degrees of freedom

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:49.140
is one minus three is minus
two, two plus two is zero.

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.950
I don't have any degrees
of freedom, I'm

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.230
stuck at one point.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:57.960
So this is an example of the
Gibbs phase rule, specific

00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:00.180
where C happens to
be equal to one.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:04.910
And then, this is a more
generalized example.

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.350
So next time, then, what we'll
do is we'll start by deriving

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:09.890
the Gibbs phase rule.

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:11.220
Which is not so hard.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.010
And then start on our way to
the colligative properties.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.900
And then you'll have an exam.
