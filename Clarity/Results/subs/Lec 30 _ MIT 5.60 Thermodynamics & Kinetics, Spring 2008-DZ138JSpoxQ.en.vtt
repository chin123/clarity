00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.920
PROFESSOR: So, now we'll start
on the last of the main topics

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.490
in the course.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.300
So we've finished most of our
macroscopic thermodynamics,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.850
and our microscopic
approach to it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.290
through statistical mechanics.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.280
And now, our final topic
is kinetics.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.920
Kinetics is really a very
different kind of topic.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.840
Because unlike thermodynamics,
thermodynamics tells you all

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.900
about equilibrium properties.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.980
A huge part of the work of this
term has been to figure

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.570
out what equilibrium is.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.620
What is the equilibrium state,
given some situation.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.290
You've got some phases
present.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.200
Different then, you could go
from solid to liquid to gas.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.570
Or you've got different chemical
constituents together

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.360
that can react and go
back and forth.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.670
What are the equilibrium
concentrations?

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.230
But we haven't worried at all
about how long it might take

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.550
to get there.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.110
And that's what kinetics does.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.980
Kinetics is concerned with rates
of reactions, primarily.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.920
How long it takes to
reach equilibrium.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.260
And of course it's
super-important.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.440
Because if you look at that
window glass, it's not in

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.360
equilibrium.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.200
It's silicon dioxide,
the equilibrium

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.550
state would be a crystal.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.210
It would be crystal
and quartz.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.980
Nevertheless, none of us is
very worried that on the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.570
moment it's likely to suddenly,
spontaneously turn

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.310
into a crystal and be opaque and
scatter light and do all

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.610
that sort of stuff.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.670
And in lots of other situations,
certainly if you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.600
look at any living biological
system, including yourselves

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.210
or your friends or any other
one, it's certainly far from

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.140
equilibrium.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.070
And you probably would hope
for it to stay that way.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.830
So there's an enormous amount
of chemistry and processes

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.770
we're concerned with.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.310
Which depend intimately on
kinetics in order to work the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.210
way they work.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.160
They also do depend on
thermodynamics and where

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.660
equilibrium states are.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.450
But that doesn't mean
they necessarily

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.790
reach equilibrium states.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.610
So we're going to go through
kinetics, starting with the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.070
simplest examples and working
our way up to

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.260
more complex cases.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.330
And just see how we can describe
elementary chemical

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.130
reaction rates and processes.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:03:02.370
So that's our concern
now, is dynamics.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.950
How long things take to
get to equilibrium.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.340
And actually just like
macroscopic thermodynamics,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.790
kinetics does take an empirical

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.390
approach to the topic.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.480
In other words, it's based on
experimental observation.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.850
Of macroscopic rates.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.860
How long it takes a collection
of stuff, a mole of stuff to

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.130
change chemically.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.330
And undergo reaction.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.560
And so forth.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.730
We often infer molecular
mechanisms based on kinetics.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.400
And it's hugely important
and valuable to do that.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.560
But it's also important to
recognize that what kinetics

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.890
can do is show us how we can
formulate microscopic

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.310
mechanisms that might be
consistent with our

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.810
macroscopic kinetics models.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.690
But the kinetics models
by themselves

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.830
don't prove the mechanism.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.650
And there are all sorts of
examples where mechanisms that

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.540
were proposed and accepted
because they were consistent

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.030
with macroscopic kinetics
results turned out to fail.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.790
There are other ways to
prove mechanisms.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.060
You might be able to design
direct spectroscopic

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.640
observations of intermediates
and so forth.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.930
And in that case, it often
becomes possible to

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.480
distinguish between different
mechanisms.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.740
Which might all satisfy the
macroscopic kinetics equation.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.600
So we use kinetics to infer a
mechanism but not necessarily

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.100
to prove it.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:05:02.320
Not generally to prove it.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.430
We also use kinetics to describe
an enormous range of

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.590
time scales.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.530
So, the fastest things that
we're sometimes concerned with

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.250
that might take place on
femtosecond time scales, 10 to

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.840
the minus 13 seconds
or so, or 10 to the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.770
minus 15 seconds, even.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.600
So, if we look at the range
of time scales we might be

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.290
concerned with, might go
anywhere from about 10 to the

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:37.580
minus 15 seconds at the fastest,
and might go to

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.700
enormous scales on
the other end.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.080
All the way out to maybe 10 to
the 10 seconds, which is on

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.090
the thousands of years.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.660
Could be longer than
that, sometimes

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.570
even millions of years.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.520
And the formalism that we'll set
up applies equally to the

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.160
full range of time scales.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.350
So it can describe an enormous
amount of chemical activity.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.740
More commonly, for stuff that
we're going to compare to, you

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.100
might measure in the lab.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.120
Common time scales range from
roughly 10 to the minus 6

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.250
seconds out to about 10
to the 5th seconds.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:30.160
That is, microseconds
to about a day.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.240
But there are plenty of examples
of going either

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.190
faster or slower, depending on
the need and the experimental

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.320
equipment available.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.080
Let's define a few terms.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.150
Let's talk about how we're
going to just formulate

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.130
chemical reaction rates.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:07:07.150
So, let's just imagine any
simple reaction of this sort.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.030
So A plus B are going to go to
C. There's some rate at which

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.360
it happens.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.960
Note, by the way, it's an
arrow in one direction.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.970
It's not an equals sign
like we've seen

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.250
before, or a double arrow.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.990
So the point I'm emphasizing
here is when we talk about

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.600
reaction rates, unlike
equilibria, we're talking

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.820
about a particular direction.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.520
Later on, we will talk about
reversible reactions.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.140
But there, too, the arrow going
this way refers only to

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.920
one of the chemical reactions
that can take place.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.240
Namely, in this case, the
changing of what was the

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.025
product now, would be the
reactant, C, back into A plus

00:07:51.025 --> 00:07:54.490
B and it has nothing to do
with the rate this way.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.840
Measured independently
and so on.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:09.790
So the rate, we can look at the
rate of disappearance of

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:21.600
A. So it's just negative
d[A]/dt, where the brackets

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.390
indicate concentration.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:31.960
Usually in moles per liter.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.540
If it's in a gas, then it would
be pA, of pressure.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.260
So negative d[A]/dt
is our rate.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.960
And note that that's generally
a positive number.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.590
We're looking at reactions
going, if it's a reaction

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.430
going in this direction.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.790
A is gradually disappearing.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.690
So we're going to define
our rate this way.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.480
To be a positive number.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.360
The rate for C is going
to be plus d[C]/dt.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.640
It's also going to be
defined in a way

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.810
that makes it positive.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.920
Because in this case, since the
reaction's going this way,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.510
we're looking at the
appearance of C.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:24.460
Now, by stoichiometry , in this
case, of course whenever

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.150
a molecule or a mole of A
disappears, a molecule or a

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.500
mole of C appears.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:37.940
So because of that, in this
case, the stoichiometry tells

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:47.480
us that that d[C]/dt is equal
to negative d[A]/dt.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.800
And also equal to negative
d[B]/dt.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:01.180
And any of those can be used to

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:13.520
define the rate of reaction.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.670
Now, this is a particularly
simple case because I've

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.510
chosen the case where all
of the stoichiometric

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.010
coefficients are equal to one.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:25.140
So now let's just look at any
case that's different.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:32.760
Let's look at 2A plus B goes to
something else, 3C plus D.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.820
And just look at the reaction
rates that we might see there.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:42.120
So here now, the appearance of
C is going to be three times

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.170
as fast as the appearance
of D, for example.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:51.650
And also three times as fast as
the disappearance of B. So

00:10:51.650 --> 00:11:00.360
if we write negative d[B]/dt,
we expect that's going to be

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.000
negative 1/2 d[A]/dt.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.020
In other words, A is going to
disappear twice as fast as B.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:15.110
Every time a molecule of B
reacts, two molecules of A do.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:21.640
And that's going to be plus 1/3
d[C]/dt, and every time

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.260
that happens three molecules
of C get formed.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:32.180
And it's going to
be plus d[D]/dt.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.100
One molecule of D gets formed.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.970
And so, the reaction rate could
be defined in terms of

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:43.600
any of these.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.470
But the important thing is to
keep track of stoichiometry so

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.080
that the rate as it pertains
to each constituent is

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:56.690
accounted for correctly.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:07.550
So to generalize, if I have
little a of A, and little b of

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:22.130
B, going to little c of C, and
little d of D, then the rate

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:32.870
of reaction can be written as
minus one over a d[A]/dt, or

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:45.230
minus one over b d[B]/dt, or
one over c d[C]/dt, or one

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.040
over d d[D]/dt.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.560
So, experimentally, lots of
measurements of reaction rates

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.420
have been made.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.190
And now to start on what's seen
empirically, basically

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:36.660
the following result is
extremely common.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.740
The rate is equal to some
constant times the

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.570
concentration of A to some
power alpha, times the

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:58.170
concentration of B to some
power beta, and so on.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.000
For all reactants.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.430
Multiplied together,
each concentration

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.720
taken to some power.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.700
Notice no products.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.490
Again, we're only looking at
a reaction going one way.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.760
And if we look at the
rate, this is

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.680
typically what's found.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:32.830
Alpha is called the order of
reaction, with respect to A.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:43.320
Beta order with respect
to B. And so on.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:53.470
And little k is our rate
constant which, just to make

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.940
clear, since we've been using it
extensively in the past few

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:03.320
lectures, is completely
not equal to

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.340
the Boltzmann constant.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:12.420
Absolutely no connection
between them.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:18.150
Now, alpha and beta, what they
are, what they turn out to be,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:23.150
is typically what's determined
as a result of kinetic

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.950
measurement.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:42.730
Typically they're
small integers.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:16:00.690
So, just sort of a typical
example, if you look at the

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:14.870
reaction of NO and O2, to make
NO2, simple reaction, and you

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:23.360
look at minus d[O2]/dt, use
that as a measure of the

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.530
reaction rate.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:31.390
What's found is that it's
a constant times NO

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:37.110
concentration squared,
times O2.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.940
Simple, right?

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.430
One of the exponents is
two, the other's one.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:49.260
Doesn't seem so surprising
mechanistically.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.720
But it's not always the case.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.750
Even when you have small
integers, it's not always the

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.560
case that the most obvious
mechanism you would infer is

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.330
the real mechanism.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.280
And sometimes those exponents
don't turn

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.810
out even to be integers.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:13.220
But here's another example.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:23.630
If you just look it CH3CHO going
to methane and carbon

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:28.480
monoxide, seems like it would
be a pretty straightforward

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.000
thing, too.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.120
So if you measure, for
example, the rate of

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:45.140
appearance of methane, what
you discover is that it's

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:50.500
equal to a constant times the
concentration of the starting

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:59.240
material to the 3/2 power.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.490
Not obvious mechanistically why
that should be the case.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.640
Usually it's telling
us something.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.140
It's telling us that the
reaction mechanism is

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.200
complicated.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.970
It's a multi-step process.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:16.170
Sometimes there could be chain
reactions and so forth.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.400
So again, seeing things like
this certainly helps us to

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.000
infer molecular mechanisms.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.820
Again, they don't prove
molecular mechanisms.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:30.250
But they certainly can be very
helpful in suggesting them.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.390
And then other means can be
used to try to prove them.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.890
Including, above all, direct
observation of the

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.400
intermediates that you would
expect on the basis of one

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:47.840
mechanism or another.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.190
Now let's just go through some
elementary examples of

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.510
kinetics one at a time.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:19:11.900
So let's start with the simplest
possible case.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.390
Actually, a very rare case, but
one that'll help us just

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.410
set up the formalism
of, and the

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.500
mechanism for us to proceed.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:32.680
So let's talk about zero
order reactions.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.890
Actually very rare.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:42.690
So, what this means is
something like A

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.070
goes over to products.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:57.715
Make a measurement of d[A]/dt,
and discover that it's k time

00:19:57.715 --> 00:20:00.710
A to the power of zero,
that is, it's just k.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.630
There's no dependence on the
concentration of A. Or

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.050
anything else.

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:11.300
And you have some rate
of its disappearance.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.880
So here's an example of it.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:29.850
You could have oxalic acid,
and it just turns into

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:35.350
hydrogen carbon dioxide
and carbon dioxide.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:41.760
Things break apart, forms
these products.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.150
Make a measurement of
the disappearance.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.960
Seems to have nothing to do with
the concentration of it.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.730
At least under certain
conditions.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:57.580
Now, turns out that there's
another element that helps

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:02.610
understand this.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.575
Turns out that light
is needed, it's a

00:21:04.575 --> 00:21:06.770
photochemical reaction.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.920
And then it's easy to see
how this can happen.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.940
Let's say we have an abundance
of the starting material, and

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.540
not very much light.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.940
So every now and then photons
bleed in, and every now and

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.200
then when they're absorbed,
it leads to dissociation.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.660
In that situation, you'll be
limited by the photons, but

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.240
not by the concentration
of the molecules.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.040
And in fact, strictly speaking
although this is zero order in

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.300
terms of the chemical
constituents, it's not zero

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.390
order in the photons.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.260
So in some sense, in this sort
of situation, the photons

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.160
should be considered one
of the reactants.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.860
You could write this as this
plus h nu plus one photon,

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.150
goes over to these products.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.510
And then if you measure the
rate and things are under

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.770
circumstances like I described,
you would discover

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.680
that in fact yes you'd
be photon limited.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.520
The rate would depend
on how many both

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.220
photons are coming in.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.390
Still, ordinarily, chemical
rate equations aren't

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.420
formulated in those terms.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.190
So in the usual formulation,
this would still have the

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:24.660
appearance of a zero
order reaction.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:30.880
Now, how do we write and
formulate a solution?

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.950
So it's simple.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.980
We've we've written a
differential equation here.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.690
It's a pretty straightforward
one.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.750
Minus d[A]/dt is just
a constant.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.000
So we can solve it.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.920
And typically we'll solve it by
rewriting in integral form

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.570
and then doing the integration
as long as we can do the

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.550
integration.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:56.090
So from here we can write the
integral from starting

00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:07.440
concentration [A]0 to some other
concentration, [A], d[A]

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:19.310
is equal to minus k integral
from zero to t dt.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:24.230
So all we've done is integrate
on both sides.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:34.790
And we've assumed a starting
concentration.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.770
We've assumed an initial
condition.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.130
And we've also assumed an
initial time, which usually we

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:57.450
can just call zero.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.390
And this is, of course,
something we can solve for

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:00.560
straight away.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:12.840
So we just have that [A] minus
[A]0 is negative kt minus

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.030
zero, which is minus kt.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:27.560
So [A] is minus kt.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.430
Plus [A]0.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.870
In other words, the
concentration of [A] at any

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.150
time is given by the initial
concentration, minus the rate

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.100
constant times time.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.900
It decays linearly in time.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:51.810
So we can sketch that.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.020
This is our initial
concentration.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:25:06.890
And then it's just going to
decline with time after that.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:09.540
And there's our solution.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.430
In lots of cases, it's
useful to define

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.510
what's called a half-life.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.560
It's just useful.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.810
Because it provides some
timeframe, a single number

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:25.250
that's a timeframe on which
the reaction occurs.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.480
So, the half-life is just the
time that it takes for half of

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:47.300
the reactants to disappear.
t 1/2 time to

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:57.390
react half the reactants.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.700
OK, so in this case it's
straightforward to see when

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.230
that happens.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.180
In other words, that's the
time at which this

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:14.580
concentration of A is just
equal to [A]0 over two.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:28.750
So we have [A]0 over two is
minus kt 1/2 plus [A]0 or t

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:35.460
1/2 is equal to [A] over 2k.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:44.020
[A]0 over 2k.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.650
So there's our half-life.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:27:02.050
So if we go over here,
we can put that in.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:13.280
[A]0 over two, and this
time is our half-life.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.820
So that's zero order
reactions.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.310
And, again, zero order
reactions are rare.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:21.890
But the procedure we're going to
used to solve for kinetics

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.150
is outlined in this way.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:34.420
And we'll use that
again and again.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.080
Let's look at first-order
kinetics.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:28:03.550
Let's go over here.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:06.360
Now, first order reactions
are quite common.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.830
Much, much more common
than zero order.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:17.550
So here, you have A
goes to products.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.070
That's the simplest case.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:26.900
But this time if we measure
d[A]/dt, we discover that it's

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:34.350
equal to a constant times the
concentration of A. There's an

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.170
important point to note here.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:43.170
What are the units of
k, in this case.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:48.780
What do they have to be?

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.230
Yeah, reciprocal
seconds right?

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.660
The equation has to work.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.090
This is concentration
per second.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.530
This is concentration.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:05.980
This better be per second.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:13.250
Let's just, before we move on
completely, look at this.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.460
What are its units?

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.470
Here's the equation.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:28.490
What are the units of k?

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.680
No, not unitless, because,
look at this.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.730
This is some concentration
unit,

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.500
typically moles per liter.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.260
So this is moles per liter
per second, right?

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.270
It's disappearance of some
concentration for time.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.250
That's got to be here.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.490
All that is here.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:51.410
Moles per liter per second.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:55.480
So in every case, the units of
k, the rate constant, have to

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.020
be figured out on the basis of
the specific rate equation.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.410
Doesn't have the same units.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:10.010
When the kinetics are
of different order.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.610
Now, let's solve this using the
same approach as before.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.000
Namely, this is still a
pretty straightforward

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.230
differential equation.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:19.140
So let's just integrate
both sides.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:30.250
So that is going to tell us the
integral from [A]0 to [A].

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:35.340
But now we have [A]
on this side.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:40.130
So here we just had
a constant.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.300
And effectively, I didn't
write it out.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:49.110
But we effectively wrote this,
rewrote this, as d[A]

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.480
equals minus k dt,
and then went

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.860
from here to the integral.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.460
We're going to do the
same thing here,

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.420
except now there's this.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.490
So really we're going
to have d[A]

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:10.250
over [A] is minus k dt.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.990
That's what we're going to
integrate on both side.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:18.880
We need to have the variables
distinct on each side.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.170
So we have d[A]

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.660
over [A].

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:31.510
Equal to minus k integral
from zero to t dt.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.590
And so, of course, you know
how to do this integral.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.560
It's going to look
like log of [A].

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.460
And again, it's taken
at [A] or, at [A]0.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:47.360
So we have log of
[A] over [A]0.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.620
We're going to have log of [A]
minus log of [A]0 coming out.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:57.250
And that's equal to minus kt.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.470
So now the kinetics are
quite different.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:15.200
We have [A] is equal to [A]0,
e to the minus kt.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.620
Very important, very common
sort of result.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.600
It's saying we start with a
certain amount of material,

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.640
and there's an exponential
decay of it.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.110
So very different from
kinetics here,

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:29.210
which are just linear.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.730
And again the kinetics here, if
you imagine that situation

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:35.420
where you've got starting
material and bleeding in

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.010
gradually are photons,
presumably at the same rate,

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:41.720
then sure that material you're
going to see the disappearance

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.590
of it linearly with time.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.790
Just depending on the
rate at which the

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.980
photons are coming in.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.860
Here it's very different
because, presumably, A is

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.250
required in order to
do this reaction.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.110
It'll depend on how much.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.780
Because of course if there's
more of it, you'll just have

00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:02.640
more at any given time decaying
over to products.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:29.250
So you have an exponential
decay.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.330
So let's plot that.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:44.570
Here's [A], let's
make that [A]0.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:54.030
There it is.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.250
Now, let's look at what happens
to the product.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:34:05.270
So let's imagine that it's A
going to B, so of course minus

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:14.150
d[A]/dt is just equal to
d[B]/dt, and the rate of

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.625
appearance of B has to match the
rate of disappearance of

00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:20.780
A. Let's assume that we
don't have any of

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.190
B present at first.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:34.700
So let's make [B]0
equal to zero.

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:43.950
Well then, [B] just has to equal
[A]0 minus [A], right?

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:48.260
All the stuff that's left, all
of the A that has disappeared,

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.560
that's given by this
difference.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:35:00.400
Is just equal to B. So that's
just [A]0 minus concentration

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.480
of A, but that's just
given by that.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:07.690
Which is [A]0 e to
the minus kt.

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:20.530
Or in other words, [B] is just
equal to [A]0 times one minus

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:24.460
e to the minus kt.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.840
So at t equals zero, this
is zero and this is one.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.750
In other words, this is going
to be zero at first.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:35.550
And then it's going to grow in
with the same exponential form

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.760
that this decayed.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.160
So, [B] is going to do
the exact opposite.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.890
It's going to be like this.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:57.550
So this is [B] of t and this is
[A] of t equals [A]0 e to

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:03.270
the minus kt.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:07.760
Now, it's always useful to,
whenever possible, to plot

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.510
these things linearly.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.060
Find a way to plot these
as straight lines.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.690
And of course in this case it's
straightforward to do

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:21.470
that as a log plot.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:27.760
So if we take the log of both
sides, we know of course that

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:42.740
the log of [A] is just minus kt,
plus the log of [A]0, so

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.100
now let's look at that.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:51.540
Make this the log of [A]0 and
this is the log of [A]

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.260
on the axis.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:56.020
That'll be time.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:07.210
So there's just some
linear decay now.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:10.010
And the slope is minus k.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.590
So experimentally, of course,
this'll be done typically as a

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:18.450
simple way of determining it.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.850
Now, we also can usefully look
at the half life, in this

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:37.740
case, in the case of first
order kinetics.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.130
So we have an expression
in general for [A].

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:55.580
So if we let [A] equal [A]0 over
two, at t equals t 1/2,

00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:08.830
that tells us that log of [A]0
over two divided by [A]0 is

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:12.220
minus kt to the 1/2.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:29.020
But this is just the log of two,
or log of two is over k

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:35.960
is t to the 1/2.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:49.030
And so t to the 1/2 is
just 0.693 over k.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.640
So we can write that just
generally, completely

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:56.020
independent of whatever [A] is,
also independent of what

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.200
[A]0 is, and that makes sense.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.490
So the point is, if you have
something that just

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:07.410
spontaneously decays into
products, maybe it's just

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.010
gradual chemical decomposition
of something.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.860
Spontaneously, without the
participation of other

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.160
constituents.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.380
There's a general half-life
that can be

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.670
associated with that.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.370
That'll just be related
directly to

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.690
the rate of the decay.

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:27.170
So it's knowable and measurable
in a simple form.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.320
And again, the half-life
is always useful.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:34.070
Because it just gives a simple,
one-number measure of

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:38.950
the rough timescale for
things to change.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:50.940
So if we go back to this plot,
and then once again here's our

00:39:50.940 --> 00:40:04.050
half concentration.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:13.620
And here's our t 1/2, just a
useful way of summarizing in a

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.970
simple way, what happens.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:15.160
Yeah?

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:21.670
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.180
PROFESSOR: Ooh.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.440
Well, I didn't think about it.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.260
But it isn't necessary
that that'll happen.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.420
Sure seems like it must be.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.370
When one is half decayed, the
other must be half formed as

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:37.470
long as there wasn't any
B present at first.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:40.010
So yeah, thank you.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:45.800
Well, given that, something
needs to move.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.480
But let's pretend like I got it
right at this intersection.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.840
Even though it doesn't
look that good.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.490
So really it should be there.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:58.950
Thank you.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:04.120
So the single most common
example of first order

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.950
kinetics of this form is
radioactive decay.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.900
You've got some radioactive
isotopic that can

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:14.100
spontaneously decay into
some other nucleus.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.590
And of course, this is measured
and half-lives have

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.610
been tabulated for lots
of cases of this sort.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:48.110
So a simple example.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:52.550
Let's look at carbon-14.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.920
It's got a nuclear
charge of six.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:04.460
It can decay into nitrogen-14
through

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:11.860
the loss of an electron.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:16.170
Happens.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.720
First order kinetics.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:21.660
Now, in the atmosphere, what
happens is this will end up,

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.990
the 14C ends up getting
replenished..

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:31.250
Because from cosmic rays, what
can happen is in the

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:39.730
atmosphere, you can have your
nitrogen plus a neutron will

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:48.600
come and form 14C plus
a hydrogen atom.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.450
So in fact, the overall
concentration in the

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:55.000
atmosphere of 14C tends to
be constant over time.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:04.140
But stuff that's formed down
here on Earth, with carbon,

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:09.090
its content of 14C decays over
time, and it doesn't get

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:12.480
replenished.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:20.670
So, let's think back
some long time ago.

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:27.640
Here's a tree. we can
make it pretty.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:35.060
So it's got some concentration
of 14C that came from carbon

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.470
dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:40.420
That's what it started with.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.660
That's our starting point.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:49.680
At some point later, through
natural occurrence or human

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:55.220
intervention, that tree
became horizontal.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:59.910
Then, and although we're looking
back here, let's call

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.520
this our t equals zero.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:16.880
And our 14C concentration
at the time is our

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.060
concentration at zero.

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.650
Now let's say, shortly after
that, either right after

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:26.130
because of deliberate action,
or shortly after because it

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:32.650
was just discovered, somebody
decides to build something

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:37.630
using that tree.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:48.200
So, early human craft.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.640
And then let's say lots later,
depending on your definition

00:44:51.640 --> 00:45:03.000
of lots, modern human, which can
be denoted by this style

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:15.830
of hat, makes exciting
discovery.

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:18.140
Terrific.

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:27.590
And would like to know
how old is it.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:31.330
How long ago did all
that stuff happen.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:39.070
Let's assume this is also
approximately t equals zero.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:55.680
Well, so a log of [14C]

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.080
over [14C]0.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.500
So this carbon dating,
all it's really doing

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.300
is measuring that.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.330
It gives a number for it.

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:12.420
And we know this because we're
assuming it hasn't changed any

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.660
in all those years.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:14.930
In the atmosphere.

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:18.330
It's different down here,
because the tree or the boat

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.810
wasn't replenished.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:23.870
Not nearly as many cosmic
rays fell on it.

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:31.320
So that's minus log of t.

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:40.420
And it turns out the t
1/2 is 5,760 years.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.800
Amazing, that this can be
known down to ten years.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.250
But it is.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:55.700
So that says, k his 0.693
divided by t to the 1/2, which

00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:04.160
is one over 8,312 years.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:12.470
So there's our answer, then.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:19.760
The time, how long ago that
happened, is just minus 8,312

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:27.710
years times the log of [14C]

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.670
in the artifact.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:34.120
Divided by the log
of, by [14C]

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.090
in the air.

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:38.600
And the assumption again is that
this is the same now as

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.230
it was back then.

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.090
And there's a bigger number than
this, so it's a positive

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:43.980
number overall.

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:47.870
So in a fairly straightforward
way, we'll use first order

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:51.480
kinetics to determine
the lifetime of

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.290
something like this.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.820
Because we know the
rate constant.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:48:01.950
And everything else follows.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:02.370
Let's see.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:04.220
Next there's going to be
second order kinetics.

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:07.290
But let me just stop here and
say just a word about the exam

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:08.410
on Wednesday.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:13.630
So I've handed out an
information sheet about it.

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:17.640
But I don't have anything very
different to say this time

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.460
than I've had to say about
previous exams.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:23.350
Solve lots of problems.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:25.250
Go over the homework.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.040
Go over practice problems.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:31.660
Try last year's exam as
a sample exam when

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.630
you're ready to do it.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.190
Try it under test conditions.

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:37.770
There's nothing on the exam that
you're going to look at

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:41.940
and say oh my God, how was I
supposed to know that we ought

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:42.600
to study that.

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.230
There won't be any surprises.

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:49.910
Most of the exam questions so
far, not all have been easy,

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:52.680
but I think they've been more
or less plain vanilla in the

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.280
sense that they're right more
or less down the middle of

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.630
what we're trying to teach.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:01.940
And not very many are taking off
little peripheral elements

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:02.680
of the class.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.860
And it's not going to be
any different here.

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.650
So if you can just do the
problem solving and get

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:10.030
familiar enough with it that
you're just good at it, so

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.970
that you can do it with a
reasonable speed, you're going

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:16.890
to be fine.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:20.770
Also try to work on just
understanding the

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:21.520
underpinnings.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.580
Especially of statistical
mechanics.

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.280
That's where when you have these
true-false or multiple

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.160
choice questions, these sort
of thought exercises.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.990
Those are really hard.

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:35.460
Because they go a little bit
beyond problem solving.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.840
If you could do the
problem solving,

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.540
you're going to do fine.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.990
But it's always useful if you
can also formulate things.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:46.510
And for that, it's never easy
to just tell you here's what

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.860
you have to do, to
get good at this.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:50.980
Because you have to
think about it.

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.750
And it's always hard.

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:56.710
But to be sure, if you can just
try when you review the

00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:00.200
statistical mechanics,
especially, and you review the

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.830
expressions that you use and
how you solve problems with

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.540
them, the next step in studying
is to try to think,

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.280
OK, do I really understand
where that

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.930
expression came from.

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.480
And why it makes sense
physically.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.610
And if you can do that, then
so much the better.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:18.530
Then you'll be in an even
stronger position.

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:22.885
The info sheet gives a handful
of equations that we do expect

00:50:22.885 --> 00:50:26.450
you to come in with those
on your fingertips.

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:27.690
There are not very many.

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.370
Mostly we'll provide expressions
that you'll need,

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:33.110
and the important thing is that
you know, understand,

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:34.060
where they apply.

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.170
And how to use them.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:38.530
So, good luck on Wednesday.
