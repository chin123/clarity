00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.280
PROFESSOR: So last
time you learned

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:30.570
about the ideal solution limits
with Henry's law and Raoult's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.620
law.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:40.110
And I just want to start
with one reminder of what

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.310
this is all about.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:50.440
So let's say that you have a
mixture of CS2 and acetone.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.680
So this is a review of
what you saw last time.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.100
Acetone like this, CH3, CH3.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:15.770
And if you take the CS2 as
the solvent and the acetone

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:27.450
as a solute, then when you plot
as a function of the amount

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.730
of CS2 here as a
solvent, then you

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.800
have the limit where the mole
fraction of CS2 goes to one,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.610
meaning that CS is the solvent.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.700
You expect Raoult to work
if it's an ideal solution.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.720
So that the vapor
pressure of CS2

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:56.690
is related to the mole
fraction of CS2 times the vapor

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.460
pressure of CS2 if it was pure.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.520
So you're sitting
here somewhere.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.490
This is the vapor
pressure of CS2 pure

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.060
and CS2 goes from zero to one.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.650
And you expect Raoult to work.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.740
So let's do Raoult.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.780
Like this.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.180
So in this area, if I were
to plot the real curve,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.070
I would expect it to start
out just like Raoult.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.160
And then there's going
to be some deviation.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.370
Then if I take the other limit,
where the mole fraction of CS2

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.030
goes to zero.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.420
So now the CS2 is the solute.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.720
And the acetone is
the solvent. what

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.700
happens for this
particular mixture is

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.230
that Henry's law
is no longer valid.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.860
Raoult's law is not valid here.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.890
Instead, you have to
look at Henry's law.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.590
And Henry's law tells you
that for the solute now,

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.160
not the solvent,
so the CS2 here is

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.960
the solute, very
small amount of it.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.090
Very small mole fraction.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.910
That the vapor
pressure of the solute

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.970
is related to the mole
fraction in the solution.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.280
But instead of having the vapor
pressure of the pure solute,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.280
you have another number.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.170
Another constant.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.790
Which we call K. Which is
a Henry's law constant.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.460
And this constant depends on
what else in the solution.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.190
It depends on the fact that
you have acetone in there.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.140
You would have a
different constant

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.620
if the acetone were replaced
with chloroform, let's say.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:00.940
So this constant here
cares what the solvent is.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.080
And it cares what the
temperature is, also.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.250
There's a lot of stuff that's
built into this constant here.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.490
It's a phinemelogical constant.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.800
And in the case of the
mixture of CS2 and acetone,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.430
the deviation from
Raoult's law is positive.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.290
Meaning that the
Henry's law constant

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:28.910
is greater than the vapor
pressure of the pure CS2.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.310
So that means that
the molecules of CS2

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.590
would rather go
in the gas phase.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.800
If there's acetone around.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.210
That means they don't
like to mix so much.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.050
They're not happy
with each other.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.140
So the CS2 molecules
would rather

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.820
escape what would normally be
a Raoult's law type of solution

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.440
to go in the gas phase away
from being close to the acetone.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.440
And as a result you get
this positive deviation.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.450
You get a higher pressure than
you expect from Raoult's law.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:13.350
So that the slope here
This slope here is K CS2.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.820
And that slope
here is p star CS2.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.520
This is a positive deviation.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.100
And you saw an example where
you if you mix chloroform

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:36.880
and acetone, you get
a negative deviation.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.010
Chloroform and acetone
are happy together

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.280
because of the hydrogen
bonding between the oxygen here

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.420
and the hydrogen in chloroform.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.610
And you get a
negative deviation.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.090
So let's start by doing
an example with numbers.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.810
Of how this might come about.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.410
Any questions on this first?

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.180
I always got confused with
Henry's law and Raoult's law.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.385
And I always got
confused as to when

00:06:10.385 --> 00:06:11.760
I was supposed to
use Henry's law

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.320
and when I was supposed
to use Raoult's law.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.610
Very confusing to me, initially.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.410
The thing to remember
is that if you're

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.630
talking about something which
in a very small amount, just

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.995
the solute, like, well I'm going
to give you an example which

00:06:29.995 --> 00:06:31.620
is a bad example,
like sugar and water.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.036
Where sugar is
clearly the solute,

00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:36.990
but sugar is not volatile
clearly this is a bad example.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.850
But something which in a very
small concentration, then

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.830
Henry's law is going to apply.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.500
Raoult's law is only going
to apply for the solvent.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.710
When you have a lot
of stuff around.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.930
On this side here
is Raoult's law.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.500
On this side here
is Henry's law.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.530
Henry's law, the deviation's
from Raoult's law,

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.210
are going to happen where
the molecules in the solution

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.696
mostly see molecules that
are not like themselves.

00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:09.570
If they mostly see
molecules like themselves,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.310
since it's an ideal
solution, then they

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.940
don't know that there's
other stuff around.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.360
In this case here, the CS2
molecules don't really know.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.950
Most of them don't know that
there's any acetone around.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.450
They couldn't care less.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.060
So it obeys an ideal solution.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.610
Here, they don't see
any other CS2 molecules.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.190
They mostly see acetone.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.859
And so Raoult's law is
going to fall apart.

00:07:31.859 --> 00:07:33.400
Because Raoult's
law assumed that you

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.720
have a single component.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.440
Or mostly one component.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.940
OK.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.990
Let's do an example.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.176
So in this case
here, we're going

00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:52.100
to work the example out here.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:08:03.390
So let's take two
components, A and B. Where

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.670
B is, and let's look
at something which

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:14.970
is a dilute solution
and non-ideal.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.620
So there's going to be some
deviation from Raoult's law.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.800
And what we're told
is at 50 degrees

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:32.050
Celsius, that the vapor pressure
of pure A is equal to 0.67 bar.

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:41.880
And the vapor pressure of
pure B is equal to 1.2 bar.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:09:02.250
So B is clearly
the more volatile.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:09.660
And we're also told,
then, that at 50 degrees

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:17.350
C we have a molar fraction of
A in the liquid phase is 0.9.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:22.620
And the molar fraction of B
in the liquid phase is 0.1.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:30.860
And the total pressure above
the solution is 0.7 bar.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.100
And eventually what we're
going to try to find out is,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.580
we're going to change
these concentrations.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.680
Are we going to
try to figure out

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.930
how the total pressure
above the solution changes.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.420
That's maybe the
goal of the problem.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.205
When you change this
to, eventually we'll

00:09:51.205 --> 00:09:54.940
change it to 0.95
and 0.05, and we'll

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.020
want to know how does that
change the total pressure.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:03.860
So immediately we see
that this is a solvent.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.700
This is a solute.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.670
This is volatile.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.170
So, we're close to
where this is zero.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.850
So if we're going to apply any,
sort of, Raoult or Henry's law

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.810
problem to this,
this is probably

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.860
going to be Henry's law for
B and Raoult's law for A.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.080
We're going to be close
to this area here for B.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.360
We're going to be close
to this area for A.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:32.960
OK.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.430
So ah the first
question is, what's

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:45.840
the composition
in the gas phase.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:53.020
What is y sub B. And it looks
like this particular set

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:59.060
of notes doesn't have
the calculations.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:12:01.230
I'm going to go to my other set
of notes here that has them.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.610
So, because I'm going
to make a mistake if I

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.390
go through it
without my notes, I'm

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.650
going to leave it up
to you to do part a.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.427
That's a good way
out of making a mess.

00:12:11.427 --> 00:12:13.010
I'm just going to
tell you the answer.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.520
Because the actual,
the interesting part,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.740
is part b of the problem.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.260
Part a is the easy part.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.920
So this is something that
you can do on your own.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.310
So yB is equal to 0.139.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:29.420
Is going to be answer to
part b, given these two molar

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.400
fractions and the
total pressure.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.010
So now, what we're
going to do is,

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.680
we're going to change
the molar fractions

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.470
and we're going to
find out how that

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:44.980
changes the total pressure.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:51.310
So, second part is we're
still at 50 degrees Celsius.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.970
And we're going to change the
molar fraction of A to 0.95.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:02.210
And the molar
fraction of B to 0.05.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:09.270
And we're going to ask,
what is p total now.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:13.110
So we write what we know.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.742
Which is that we
expect p total to be

00:13:15.742 --> 00:13:21.590
the sum of the partial pressures
of A and B. A is the solvent,

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.050
B is the solute.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.160
It's a dilute
non-ideal solution. pA

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.002
is going to be proportional
to Raoult's law,

00:13:31.002 --> 00:13:31.960
because it's a solvent.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.600
It's in large quantities.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.870
So it's going to be xA pA star.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.800
And xB is going, and
pB is going to be

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.240
proportional to the
mole fraction again.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.370
But because it's a solute, it's
seen most the other molecules

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.200
of A around, it's
not necessarily

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.030
going to be obeying
Raoult's law.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.045
It's going to obey Henry's law.

00:13:56.045 --> 00:13:57.972
It's going to be close
to the zero point.

00:13:57.972 --> 00:14:00.430
There's going to be a deviation
because of the interactions

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.950
between A and B.
Which dominate now.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.220
So instead of pA
star, we have KB here,

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.920
where this is the
Henry's law constant.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.064
Which depends on the
fact that A is around.

00:14:11.064 --> 00:14:13.480
We get a different constant
if we have a different solvent

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.350
around.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.500
So we know this.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.780
We know this because that was
given to us at the beginning.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.020
But we don't know this here.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.670
We don't know what the
Henry's law constant here is.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.160
But we can get it.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.050
We can get it from part a here.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.850
Because we have all the
information we need there.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:42.380
So from part a, we
already have a mixture

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.810
where we're given
the total pressure.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:53.840
So from part a,
KB is pB over xB.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:00.990
And we calculated
what yB is over there.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.680
On part a.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.130
So we know what the
partial pressure of B is.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.500
It's the molar fraction
of B in the gas

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.040
phase times the total pressure.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:18.270
That's Dalton's law.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.780
Then we divide by xB.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:25.840
And then we plug in
the number 0.139 times

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.990
the total pressure
up there is 0.7.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.780
Divided by 0.1.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:40.350
And we get that
this is 0.973 bar.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:49.410
So now we can plug this
in to our equation here.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:55.450
We know xA, we know xB, we know
Raoult's law, the 0.67 pA star.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.240
We know KB here.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.240
We plug in all the
numbers, and we

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.890
get that the total
pressure is now 0.685 bar.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.900
This is a pretty typical
example of a problem that

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:13.510
combines Raoult's law, Henry's
law and Dalton's law together.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:18.630
And keeping track of these laws
takes a little bit of thinking.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:23.400
And it's very, very common
on problem sets or exams

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.110
to mix these up.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.360
So it's good to go
through examples like this

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.247
and really keep track of
where each law applies.

00:16:34.247 --> 00:16:35.830
Dalton's law applies
in the gas phase.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.180
It's partial pressure
in the gas phase.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.850
Henry's law is the pressure.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.670
If you know what's happening in
the liquid phase, for a solute.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.080
Raoult's law is the partial
pressure in the gas phase,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.160
if you know what's happening
in the liquid phase.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.910
So Raoult and Henry tell you
something about the pressure

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.040
if you know the liquid.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:59.950
Dalton only deals with what's
happening in the gas phase.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:06.640
OK, any questions
on the problem?

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.140
Alright.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.870
So we did this problem
here, and now let's

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:16.810
draw the phase diagram for our
solute here, or for B, rather.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.860
Zero to one.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:23.110
And let's take a vote here.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:31.160
So if Raoult's law worked for
B, for the mixture of A and B,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.360
then we would have pB star here.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.760
And everything would be great.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.220
But Raoult's law doesn't work.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.360
Close to molar fraction of zero.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.580
Instead, Henry's law.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.750
There's a deviation,
due to the interactions

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.760
between the molecules
A and B here.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.070
So we have two choices
for the deviation.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:55.230
We can have a
positive deviation,

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.670
or we could have a
negative deviation.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:02.150
Positive deviation,
if the molecules of B

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.070
would rather be
in the gas phase,

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.570
than be in the mixture
in the liquid phase.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.540
Meaning they don't
like molecules of A.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.460
They don't like to be
mixed with molecules

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:23.090
of A. The energy of
interaction is not favorable.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.970
The enthalpy is not
favorable, for mixing

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.245
A and B. In this case
here, the enthalpy

00:18:28.245 --> 00:18:32.920
is favorable for mixing A and B.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:37.100
So in this problem here,
which do you think it is?

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.650
The blue one or the green one.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:40.900
Let's raise hands here.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:47.070
How many people think
it's the blue one here.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.770
Anybody else?

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.270
The right answer,
we have four people.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.680
How many people think
it's the green one?

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.640
Four.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.140
Five.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.120
Six.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.290
You didn't vote twice, did you?

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.110
Vote early, vote often, right?

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.570
Mayor Daley, the old
Mayor Daley in Chicago.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.350
And if you know somebody
who's dead, vote for them.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.370
OK, so this is the, I've
got about five people here.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.640
And a bunch of
people didn't vote.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.190
So it's a tie.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:27.751
It's basically a tie here.

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:29.250
I think you should
think about this.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.833
Maybe talk to each
other a little bit.

00:19:30.833 --> 00:19:36.470
See if you can figure
out, given all the numbers

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.430
that are in this
problem here, you

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:46.240
know what, the pure
pressure on the solvent is.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.530
We change concentrations here.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.240
Got Henry's law constant out.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.615
And Henry's law
constant is going

00:19:54.615 --> 00:19:56.906
to tell you whether or not
that enthalpy of interaction

00:19:56.906 --> 00:20:02.636
is favorable or not favorable.

00:20:02.636 --> 00:20:04.177
It's going to be a
positive deviation

00:20:04.177 --> 00:20:34.760
or a negative deviation.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.940
OK, shall we vote again.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.420
How many people say
it's the blue one?

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.130
How many people say
it's the green one.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.640
Thank you.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.480
Alright.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.100
Good.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.600
Alright.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.230
We have K sub B is
less than p star,

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.410
therefore it's a
negative deviation.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.540
The pressure is less
than you'd expect.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.040
The molecules like each
other better than you expect.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.130
There is a favorable enthalpy
of interaction between A and B.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.360
They like to interact.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.940
It could be hydrogen bonding.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.900
Could be a lot of
different things.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:16.570
OK, so now if I put the
whole diagram together,

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.720
which I shouldn't
have erased here.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.580
Right, so there's my
diagram here again.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.360
There's Raoult's law.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.660
There's the deviation
from Raoult's law here.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.000
For one substance,
let's say for B. There's

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.010
Raoult's law for A. There's
a deviation for A. It

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.590
could be like this.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.920
And if I now add
these two together,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.380
instead of having
a diagram for, this

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:55.300
is a pressure xB, yB diagram,
pressure xB, yB diagram,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:00.490
instead of having Raoult's
law sitting right here.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:05.990
And then the yB part down
here below, your usual sort

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:10.220
of ideal solution phase
diagram with the high pressure

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.940
of the liquid on top and
the gas on the bottom.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:19.560
Now if you add the blue curve
and the red curve together,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.340
you're not going to
get a straight line

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.600
like you did before.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.220
When Raoult's law
applied throughout.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.850
Instead you're going
to get a deviation

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.620
from the straight line.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.140
You're going to
get a curve that's

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.000
always below the straight line.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.390
Because we have the negative
deviation on both sides.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.350
So you end up with
something that's

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.070
curved and deviates below.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:45.930
And the same thing will
happen for the bubble line.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.100
It will also deviate below.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.230
In some way.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.440
Maybe not as much, maybe.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.030
So this is what you usually see.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.280
You see deviation of
that whole phase diagram,

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.720
like you're pushing down on it.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.300
Or maybe it didn't pulled up.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.380
If you have a
positive deviation,

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.140
then it's the opposite.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.720
It gets, this is
negative deviation.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.820
And if you have a
positive deviation,

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.550
instead of having a
usual phase diagram,

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:21.270
you're going to get something
that's looking like this.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.890
Which is the Henry's
law coming in.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:23.390
Yes.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.225
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:26.225 --> 00:23:26.850
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.340
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.000
PROFESSOR: Doesn't matter.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.340
Good question, though.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.030
OK, so this is what
it usually looks like.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.720
And everything
you've learned so far

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.190
can be applied to
these diagrams here.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.460
There's one exception, though,
which is an important one.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.430
Which is, sometimes,
these non-ideal diagrams

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.250
have a funny spot.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.900
Which is that if I
draw them, so there's

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.850
my xB, yB, on the bottom.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.150
Zero to one.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.540
I have pressure here.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:11.930
Sometimes, there's the dew line.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.540
And the bubble line.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.410
Sometimes, instead of
having a nice separation

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.380
between the bubble
and the dew line,

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.390
there's a special point
which for some reason

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:30.030
those two curves meet.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.460
Non-ideality.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.600
There's interaction
between the molecules.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.140
In the gas phase and
the liquid phase.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.750
This special point is
an interesting one.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:46.880
Because, well, if I'm away
from this special point,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.590
let's say I'm sitting to the
left of the special point,

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.680
right here.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.180
And I can distill this thing.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.860
I can take my gas phase here.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.080
And increase the pressure.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.220
Say I'm sitting here in
the mixture, gas phase

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:13.930
mixture with x prime B, y
prime B. Sorry, x prime B.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.270
And I go up and I
increase the pressure.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.960
Start making vapor.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:27.524
Start making vapor, I
can find out what the,

00:25:27.524 --> 00:25:28.440
I start making liquid.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.523
I can find out where the
composition in the liquid

00:25:30.523 --> 00:25:34.920
is by going over to
the blue line here.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.170
That tells me the
composition in the liquid.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.454
And reading off the composition
of the liquid down here.

00:25:41.454 --> 00:25:43.620
So this is actually the
composition in the gas phase

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:47.620
is yB prime. yB prime
is the gas phase.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.150
I'm starting here.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.190
I start to increase
the pressure.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.880
I begin the
distillation process.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.460
And I get a little
bit of liquid out.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.330
And I can read off the
composition in the liquid. xB

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:00.840
prime.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.150
And I know from this diagram
that xB prime is less then

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.250
yB prime.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.460
So I'm enriching
my liquid in A. I'm

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.370
purifying my
solution in A, right?

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.690
I can get pure A out eventually.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.820
The fact of doing
this, I can get pure A.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.520
So I decrease the pressure,
I get the pure gas phase

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.650
of my new solution here.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.157
And I increase the pressure.

00:26:27.157 --> 00:26:28.990
And go over and make a
little bit of liquid.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:30.369
And capture that liquid.

00:26:30.369 --> 00:26:32.160
And repeat the process
over and over again.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.490
And eventually I have pure A.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:41.190
Now, suppose I'm sitting
here at this special point.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:49.420
And I'm starting with yB And
let me call it a here. yB of a.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.087
I'm sitting right here.

00:26:51.087 --> 00:26:52.420
And I'm increasing the pressure.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.630
I go all the way up here.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.230
And I start making liquid. .

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.000
What's the composition
of liquid, compared

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.670
to the composition
of the gas phase?

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:05.460
What's y?

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:13.140
What's xB compared to yB
of this point up here?

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.420
It's the same.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.530
So I'm making liquid.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.600
I got the same composition.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.150
Doesn't help me.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.390
If I make a gas again, I still
have the same composition.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.020
I can't distill.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.860
I can't purify it.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:35.350
So if I have this special
mixture here, of A and B,

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:46.442
at this point here, I form
what's called an azeotrope.

00:27:46.442 --> 00:27:47.900
And then you can't
separate it out.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.690
You can't separate out
the mixtures into A and B.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.860
You can't distill it
at that point here.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:02.420
Now, you can draw the same
diagram in, instead of

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.610
pressure, mole fraction, you
can draw the same diagram

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.090
in terms of temperature.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.560
And the same thing happens.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:16.050
You can have
deviations from, this

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:19.860
is the extra figures that
are on the bottom page

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.220
of the notes from
last time here.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.630
That we've replaced here.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:29.480
You can have a
positive deviation.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.430
With a positive azeotrope.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:34.660
And your T p
diagram, T x diagram.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.720
Or you can have, depending
on the interactions

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.650
between the two
molecules, you can

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:43.100
have something that has
a negative deviation.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:48.060
And a negative azeotrope here.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:52.630
So in this case here, this is
a particularly awful situation.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.940
Because there's your
liquid phase down here.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.210
There's the gas phase here.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:04.260
And now, suppose
that you're doing

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.660
some sort of distillation.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:12.420
So you start here in the liquid
phase, with some composition.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.791
You make a gas.

00:29:15.791 --> 00:29:17.790
Let's say you're doing a
fractional distillation

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.850
of some sort.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:23.610
Your gas now has a new mixture.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.760
So this is the composition
in the gas phase.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.920
You take that gas phase
mixture, and you condense it

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.670
in your condenser.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.630
In your fractional
distillation condenser.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.270
So now I've condensed it.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:40.400
And I heat it up again.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.990
I've condensed it.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.300
So I'm here somewhere.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.470
And cool it down so
that I have a liquid.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:48.910
And I condense it.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.890
And slowly I move over
to the azeotrope point.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.990
And once I get there, I'm stuck.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.410
And the same thing happens
if I'm on the other side.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:04.600
I'm on this point here, I
keep my solution, my mixture.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.010
I make a gas, I read off the
composition of the gas phase

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.510
here.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:11.180
I take my gas phase composition
out and I re-liquefy it.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.900
So I'm here, down
here somewhere, again.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.010
And I heat it up again.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.570
And and I move to
the azeotrope point.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.470
That's what happens if you have
a mixture of benzene and water,

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.240
for instance.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.430
You can't distill it.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.439
You work your way down
to this point here.

00:30:30.439 --> 00:30:31.980
You can't use
fractional distillation

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.510
until you've separated it out.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:36.520
So this is a real life problem.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.250
And you have to do things
like change the pressure.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:43.150
Do your distillation under
high pressure or low pressure.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.340
To try to get this
point to separate out.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.320
So you can get past this point.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.860
Or to try to get the deviation
to become of the opposite sign.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.940
Where you can start to
do some distillation.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.330
Any questions on
azeotropes, before we

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:04.970
get to colligative properties?

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.990
If you're doing
organic chemistry,

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.590
and you're trying
to purify things,

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.660
this is a real pain, right?

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.710
Pain in the neck.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:21.982
So you've got to know, which
things form azeotropes.

00:31:21.982 --> 00:31:23.940
So we're going to start
colligative properties.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.523
There are four
colligative properties,

00:31:25.523 --> 00:31:28.570
and you already
know what they are.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.970
And you've even seen
the math behind them.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.540
And in fact, you've seen
the math for one of them

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:41.461
already pretty clearly.

00:31:41.461 --> 00:31:42.960
And these colligative
properties are

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:50.650
properties that you use all the
time in your day to day life.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:54.690
At least, three of them.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:32:27.630
OK what are the four
colligative properties?

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.940
There is vapor
pressure lowering.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:34.130
If you have a mixture and the
vapor pressure of the mixture

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.470
is less than the vapor
pressure of the pure material,

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:43.570
there's the boiling
point elevation.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:50.270
If you add a large amount of
insoluble - not insoluble,

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:55.720
non-volatile solute to a
solution, you will depress,

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.220
you will increase the boiling
point of that solution like

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.184
the example of the salt
and water that I gave.

00:33:01.184 --> 00:33:02.850
So if you need a lot
of salt to increase

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.030
the boiling point of water.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:12.850
There's the freezing
point depression.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:17.720
That's what we use to
melt ice in the winter.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.410
By adding salt to it.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:23.470
Then there's the
osmotic pressure.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:28.880
Which is the example of the
freshwater fish in salt water,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.790
or the saltwater
fish in fresh water.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:35.310
Or the cells bursting
when you put them in.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:41.040
OK, so these colligative
properties all come

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:45.590
from the fact if
I have a mixture,

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:51.650
the chemical potential of
a molecule in a mixture,

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:55.245
in the liquid
phase here, is less

00:33:55.245 --> 00:34:02.530
than the chemical
potential of the pure guy.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:14.590
Where A is the solvent,
and B is some solute.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:18.060
So this is always true if
your number of moles of A

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.620
is much larger than
number of moles of B. Mix

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.150
a little bit of B in there,
and the chemical potential of A

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.930
in the liquid is
going to come down.

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:28.350
Because of the mixing process.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:30.910
Because of the
entropy of mixing.

00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:36.520
And that's going to give
rise to these properties.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:41.290
And, to do these, one more
thing before we start.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:47.410
We're going to use a special
concentration for these guys.

00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:50.480
We're going to use,
call something molality.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.600
Molality.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:58.310
Molality is the number
of moles of solute

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:07.050
divided by kilograms of solvent.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:12.370
So it's moles per
weight of solvent.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.870
As opposed to moles
per liter, which

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:16.420
is something that
we're more used to.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.000
Moles per kilograms of solvent.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.230
It's pretty close to
moles for liter for water.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:23.890
Because a gram of water
is a milliliter, roughly.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:28.320
The density of
water's close to one.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.060
So let's start on these things.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:41.130
So we've already seen this.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:47.740
You've already seen
vapor pressure lowering.

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.690
It comes from Raoult's law.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:55.620
If I look at the change in
the vapor pressure of A, pA

00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:04.790
minus pA star. pA is equal to
xA pA star. xA pA star, that's

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.060
Raoult's law.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:11.930
Minus pA star, that's
equal to one minus xA.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.740
Minus pA star.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:21.170
Which is minus xB pA star.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:25.290
Which is less than zero.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:31.070
So, that means that the vapor
pressure above the solution

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.000
is lowered.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.290
So I should have said
vapor pressure lowering.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:41.760
And we also drew a
phase diagram to show

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.490
how this vapor
pressure lowering was

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:50.600
going to imply freezing point
depression and boiling point

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.340
depression.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:37:01.260
So now let's go on and look at
the freezing point depression.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:01.760
Number two.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:08.300
We're going to find that the
change in the boiling point

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.190
is going to be some constant
K sub b, which is not

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.140
to be confused with
Henry's law's constant.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.790
It's completely different.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.480
This is a colligative property.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.490
Times the molality
of B. That's going

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.860
to be the answer
we're going to get.

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:26.020
Amount of temperature
change depends linearly

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.640
on the molality of
B, with a constant

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.990
that depends on
what the mixture is.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:33.890
And what the pressure is.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.860
Whenever we derive anything
connected to phase transitions,

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.610
we usually always
start with the fact

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:42.290
that the chemical
potential changes.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:43.965
And it has to be
equal at equilibrium.

00:37:43.965 --> 00:37:45.340
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:51.370
We're going to start with
the chemical potential equal

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:53.980
of the liquid phase is equal
to the chemical potential

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.500
of the gas phase.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.790
For the solvent at equilibrium.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:05.330
And the liquid phase
obeys Raoult's law.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.810
So it's going to be the chemical
potential of the pure material.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.770
The pure liquid.

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:15.040
Plus RT log xA.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.440
So this is where the mixing
of the solute comes in.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.480
And on the gas phase
side, mu A, it's

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.944
going to be the same thing
as the chemical potential

00:38:26.944 --> 00:38:28.360
of the pure A.
Because we're going

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:35.540
to take B to be non-volatile.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.060
So the only thing
in the gas phase

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.760
is A. Same chemical
potential as if it were pure.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.200
Because it is pure.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:50.850
So now we solve for log xA
is equal to one over RT mu

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:58.810
A star in the gas phase minus
mu A star in the liquid phase.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.480
And this is just the
Gibbs free energy

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.980
per mole of A in the gas phase.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.520
The Gibbs free energy per
mole of A in the liquid phase.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.470
So we can replace this with
the change in Gibbs free energy

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.840
from going from gas to liquid.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.343
Per mole, which
is just the Gibbs

00:39:13.343 --> 00:39:15.270
free energy of vaporization.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:19.460
We're going from liquid to gas.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.410
And I probably have a
negative sign somewhere.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:25.160
No this is right, this
is the final state.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.400
This is the initial state.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.030
Divided by RT.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:33.275
OK.

00:39:33.275 --> 00:39:34.900
That's not really
what we want, though.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.010
What we want is
delta T. Here I've

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.180
got some complicated
equation that has T in it,

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.920
but not delta T.
But before we do

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.930
that, before we transfer
and try to get a delta T out

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.930
of this equation,
let's see if we

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:51.650
can do any sort of
simplifications here.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:54.040
I don't like to
carry logs around.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.930
There are no logs around here.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:40:03.230
So let's see if we can
get rid of that log.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:08.780
What is log xA?

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.640
Log xA, well, xA
is close to one.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.700
It's connected to xB.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.640
And everything in
here is connected

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.030
to B. There's a
molality of B here.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.060
The concentration of A
doesn't come into play here.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.310
I don't want it there.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:27.880
So let me replace it with B. one
minus xB. xB is a small number.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.180
It's a solute, it's
in small amount.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.020
We're close to being
a pure solvent here.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.520
So one minus
something very small.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.940
The log of that.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:41.460
Well if you've worked
with Taylor's expansions.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:46.320
You probably know that
that's close to minus xB.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.330
The log of one minus
x where x goes to zero

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.820
is close to minus x.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.050
So that's minus xB.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.590
Now, minus xB, in
terms of the moles,

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.130
is the number of moles of B
divided by the number of moles

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:02.560
of B plus the number of moles
of A, the total number of moles.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.660
The number of moles
of B is very small,

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:10.310
compared to the number of moles
of A. So I can get rid of this.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:11.860
So, and there's a
minus sign here.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:17.170
So this is approximately
minus nB divided by nA.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:20.710
Now, the only I can do is, I'm
trying to get at molality here.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.450
I said we're going
to use molality.

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:23.226
Got moles.

00:41:23.226 --> 00:41:24.850
I don't have kilograms
of solvent here.

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:25.990
I have moles of solvent.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.840
I'm not so happy with that.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.905
So, in order to get something
that has kilograms out,

00:41:30.905 --> 00:41:37.170
let's multiply up and down by
capital M where capital M is

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:40.760
that total mass of A. Basically
the number of kilograms

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.680
of solvent.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:50.840
Total mass of A. So
now, this fraction here,

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.880
that's the molality.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.430
That's what I'm looking for.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.850
So this is minus the molality.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:03.330
Then I have the total
mass of A divided

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:08.010
by the number of moles
of A. Well, that's

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.296
the molecular weight of it.

00:42:09.296 --> 00:42:11.004
Total mass divided by
the number of moles

00:42:11.004 --> 00:42:12.600
is the molecular weight.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.370
So this is the molality of
B times the molecular weight

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:18.790
of A. OK.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:22.820
So now I can plug this
instead of log xA.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:29.930
And I get minus nB times
nA is equal to delta

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:38.830
G of vaporization divided by RT.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:42.360
Let's rearrange a little bit.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.690
And mB is equal to to delta
G vaporization divided

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:52.220
by nA times RT, with
a negative sign.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.350
Well, I've eliminated
the log at least,

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.110
but I still don't have
a delta T in there.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.590
I don't have a delta
T. How am I going

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.780
to get a delta T in there?

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.770
Got to get the delta T.
Everything's very small.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.350
So one way to get a small
change in temperature

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.640
is to take a derivative
with respect to temperature.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.970
That's going to get
a delta T in there.

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:14.140
So I'm going to take the
derivative of both sides

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.930
with respect to T.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:18.550
And delta T is going
to come out that.

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:25.840
I'm going to take d nB
/ dT, constant pressure.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:36.560
Minus one over mA times
R d delta G over T. This

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:43.170
is delta G of vaporization.
dT, constant pressure.

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:47.070
And I wish I'd made my
boards a little bit better.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:51.720
Because I have to
cover things up.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.470
OK, now I have this derivative
of the Gibbs free energy

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:56.590
divided by the temperature.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:59.910
This turns out to be something
that you've seen before.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:10.220
It's called the
Gibbs-Helmholtz equation.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.940
And it relates the temperature
change in the Gibbs free energy

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.220
with the enthalpy change.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:23.490
The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation
is that the d delta G over T dT

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:28.050
is equal to minus
delta H over T.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:31.720
And you can get that from just
writing fundamental equations

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.735
about G and H. And
turning the crank.

00:44:34.735 --> 00:44:36.710
And we've done that before.

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:39.250
And I'll leave that
as an exercise for you

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.460
to go back and figure
out what, you can go back

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.820
to your textbook and look
at, you know under the index.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:49.000
Gibbs-Helmholtz, and figure
out why this is the case.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.560
So now, we have
this equation here.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.143
This is going to be
nice, because it's

00:44:52.143 --> 00:44:53.890
going to get rid of the d/dT.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.200
On the right-hand side.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.960
And so now our
equation becomes d

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:09.360
mB / dT is equal to delta H
vaporization divided by mA R T

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.340
squared.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:17.170
Now, I can rewrite this in
a slightly different way.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:20.220
This is delta m over
delta T, basically.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.446
Delta the change
in number of moles.

00:45:22.446 --> 00:45:23.820
I mean, the molality
of B divided

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.028
by the change in temperature.

00:45:25.028 --> 00:45:26.540
I'm getting very close here.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.430
There's a change in
temperature here.

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.580
There's a change
in molality here.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.400
I can rewrite this
as delta T, then,

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.380
is equal to molecular
weight of A times

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:46.530
RT squared divided by delta H
vaporization times delta mB.

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.610
Now, I'm making a very
small change in B here.

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:50.420
Starting at zero.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:53.530
Basically I'm taking
pure A and I'm

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.890
dumping in a little
bit of B. That's

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:58.990
what I'm doing
when I experiment.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:01.519
I'm dumping in a little
bit of B in my pure A,

00:46:01.519 --> 00:46:04.060
and I'm trying to figure out
how the temperature is changing.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:08.690
So I'm doing delta m sub
B is my small amount of B

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:10.470
that I'm adding to the solution.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.160
Minus what I started out
with, which was zero.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:18.114
So delta mB is basically
m sub B. Right?

00:46:18.114 --> 00:46:19.280
That's basically what it is.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.630
So let's get rid
of this delta here.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:22.930
What else can I say?

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:25.490
Well, I can say that the
temperature change that I'm

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:27.019
looking at is also pretty small.

00:46:27.019 --> 00:46:28.560
Compared to the
absolute temperature.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.380
This is a small change.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.350
I'm only adding a small
amount of B in there.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:38.000
So this temperature up here is
not going to change very much.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.530
Let's take it to
be the temperature

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:45.100
of the boiling point
of the pure material.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:50.570
T sub B star, of
the pure material.

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:53.190
OK And there's my delta T here.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.025
So this is of the
form delta T is

00:46:56.025 --> 00:47:03.290
equal to molecular weight
of A. Times R. Times

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:06.250
the boiling point of the
pure material squared.

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.250
Divided by delta
H of vaporization

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.750
of the pure solvent.

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:19.140
Times the molality of B. And
this combination of properties

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:23.360
of A, the molecular weight of
A, the boiling point of pure A.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:32.300
The heat of vaporization of
pure A, this is K sub b up here.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.670
Which I covered up.

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:44.700
It's of the form delta T is
equal to K sub b times mB.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:50.580
And this turns out to be
always greater than zero.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.530
Now.

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:54.720
If you want to look at
freezing point depression,

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.200
it's really easy.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:07.830
In your equations, it's the
same thermodynamic picture.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.730
All you need to do,
in all your equations,

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:15.590
you replace delta
G of vaporization

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:19.200
with minus delta G of freezing.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:24.410
When we did a vaporization,
we're going from liquid to gas.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:26.710
We had delta G of vaporization.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.730
When we're doing freezing
point depression,

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:34.350
we're going from
liquid to solid.

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:40.450
And so we have to use
minus delta G of fusion.

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.674
Minus delta H of
fusion. s to l would

00:48:42.674 --> 00:48:44.090
be the positive
delta G of fusion.

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:47.150
So we're going from
liquid to solid.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.900
We have to replace
delta G of vaporization

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.910
with delta G of fusion.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.810
We replace delta
H of vaporization,

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:57.220
where minus delta H of fusion.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:01.380
Replace the boiling point
with the freezing point.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.980
And replace K sub
b with K sub f.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:08.740
And the math is
exactly identical.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:13.110
It all starts from the chemical
potentials being equal.

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.220
And turning the crank
at equilibrium, being

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.560
equal between the solid
phase and the liquid phase.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.620
And turning the crank.

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.910
The solid phase is
like the gas phase.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:24.680
It's a pure A, pretty much.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.380
Because the molecules
of B are stuck.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.769
And A doesn't know that B's
around, in the solid phase.

00:49:30.769 --> 00:49:32.810
They know that they're
around in the liquid phase

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:35.500
because the fusion
fast enough. .

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.600
And then we can write,
if we turn the crank,

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.590
we get an equation
that looks like this.

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:43.990
The freezing point depression
is equal to minus mA

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:48.810
R Tf star squared.

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:53.670
Divided by delta H
of fusion, for mole.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.240
Times the molality
of B. And this number

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.740
is always less than zero.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.510
There's the negative
signs in here.

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:03.090
OK.

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:05.050
Always depressed.

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:09.840
Any questions about those
freezing point depression

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.840
and boiling point elevation.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.820
Yes.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:20.000
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR:
Why did I drop it here?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.850
Because the small change
that I'm making in nB

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:27.840
is going from pure
A, where nB is zero,

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:31.330
to a very small amount of nB.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:34.550
That's why I'm
allowed to say this.

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:38.230
And then just replace
delta nB with nB.

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:40.020
I'm comparing every,
my reference point

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.550
is the pure material.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:44.850
I'm just adding a little
bit to start with.

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:45.910
It's a good question.

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:50.730
Any other questions?

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:51.300
OK.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.670
I didn't get to
osmotic pressure.

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:56.580
You'll get to that on Friday.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.190
And also start
statistical mechanics.

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:03.090
And after osmotic pressure,
you'll be done with thermo.

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:05.800
It'll be statistical
mechanics and then kinetics.
