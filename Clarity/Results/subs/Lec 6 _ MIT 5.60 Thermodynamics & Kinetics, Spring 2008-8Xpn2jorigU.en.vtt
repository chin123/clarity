00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.530
PROFESSOR NELSON: Well, today
we're going to continue with

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.200
the lecture that was started
last time that had the

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.830
scintillating and descriptive
title "some thermodynamic

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.250
processes".

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.490
And we're going to continue
along those lines, and really

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.720
there a couple of things that I
want to do to follow up what

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.000
you saw last time.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.150
One is that you've got
introduced and led through a

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.250
couple of elementary
thermodynamic cycles.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.830
And I want to do a little
bit more of that today.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.990
And one of the -- there are
really two reasons.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.650
One is that as you saw last
time doing a thermodynamic

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.570
cycle can be extremely useful,
because if you have one path

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.800
along which some change occurs,
but along which it's

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.670
not necessarily easy to
calculate all of the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.710
thermodynamic changes along
such a path, it may be

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.450
irreversible, lots of variables
may change.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.850
It can be easier instead of
looking at the complicated

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.810
path to devise a cycle that
involves several easier steps,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.520
each one of which is facile for
the calculation of what

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.730
happens to the thermodynamic
properties.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.310
So in that case, it's much
easier to go through several

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.730
elementary step, and then the
one complicated path you know

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.140
because going around the entire
cycle state functions,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.240
you know that they won't
have any change.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.020
So in that sense, going through
a thermodynamic cycle

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.920
can be useful because it
helps you calculate

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.930
thermodynamic qualities.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.290
But the other reason to go
through the thermodynamic

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.380
cycles and really to develop
great facility with them is

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.680
because there are just an awful
lot of things in nature

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.300
and things that we build that
run in cycles, where we want

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.090
to calculate the thermodynamics,
right.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.140
If we build an engine for a
car or anything else, it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.720
almost always is going to have
some key element that's

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.560
operating in a cycle,
otherwise it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.700
won't keep going, right.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.590
But it's not just engines
that we might build.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.390
It's biological engines,
right.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.680
Things that either produce or
consume biological fuel to do

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.180
different sorts of processes.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.290
Also, of course of key
importance to understand what

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.810
the, in that case, biological
thermodynamics are.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.550
And again, there'll be key
elements that run in cycles

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.110
and understanding those can
be extremely important in

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.180
understanding how cellular
function works.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.260
OK, so what I'd like to do is go
through one cycle, and then

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.540
I'll suggest another for you to
work through on your own.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.930
So consistent with the title
of the lecture, we've got a

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.910
section from your last lecture
notes entitled "some

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.980
thermodynamic cycles".

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.260
And what we're going to do is
go through a cycle, please

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.150
note these office hours and
locations, which I think

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.200
wasn't specified before.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:33.170
So we're going to go through
a thermodynamic cycle, and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.630
here's what I want to calculate
when we do this.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.610
Delta u, delta H, familiar state
functions, changes in

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.230
their values, q, w,
heat and work.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.990
And I also want to introduce
one new function.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.950
I won't give it a name yet,
but it's going to have the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:15.500
unusual form dq over
T. OK, we'll

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.620
call it special function.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.350
It's so special that we'll
call this quantity dS.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.475
OK, we'll just go through this
on a whim, and this is going

00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:37.960
to be foreshadowing something
that'll take on tremendous

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.470
importance in subsequent
lectures, but I'm going to use

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.580
the opportunity now to just
introduce the behavior of it

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.650
in going around a cycle.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.780
If that's for me, tell
them I'm busy please.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:05:01.840
OK, so let's look at the
cycle we'll go through.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.100
We're going to look at pressure
volume changes,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.990
similar to what you
saw before.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:19.960
This time, we're going to have
initial and final volumes, V1

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.990
and V2 and different pressures
where we might end up.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.130
And we're going to look
at two ways to go to a

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.840
final volume V2.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.740
One of them is going to end up
at pressure p2 and the other

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.580
is going to end up
at pressure p3.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:50.010
One of them is going to be a
reversible isothermal path.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.060
This is going to be our path
we'll label A, reversible

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:05.950
isothermal which is to say
constant T, right?

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.860
And we're going to start at
temperature T1, so since it's

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.940
constant temperature, this
is going to end up

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.490
at temperature T1.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.480
And then we're also going
to consider a reversible

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.760
adiabatic path.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:36.820
This'll be our path B,
reversible adiabatic.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.410
And then we'll close this
circle, this cycle.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.080
This is going to end
up at a different

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.140
temperature by the way.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.140
You saw this last time in a
slightly different way.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.600
Last time what you saw is we
compared isothermal and

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.720
adiabatic paths that ended up
at the same final pressure,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.650
and what you saw is that
therefore, they ended up in

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.460
different final volumes.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.590
So this is just a little bit
different from that.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.560
So this is going to end up at a
different temperature, we'll

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.380
call it T2.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.740
And then we're going
to close the cycle.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.010
And so this is a constant
volume path then.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:19.030
This is path C, constant
volume.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.280
OK?

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.540
So now let's go around the cycle
and just compare notes

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.400
on what happens to
the thermodynamic

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.660
quantities as we do that.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:39.960
So here's path A,
it's isothermal.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.610
And I didn't specify, but let's
make sure to do so,

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:52.740
we've got a, it's going
to be an ideal gas.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:59.790
OK, so A is constant
temperature.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:07.890
What does that mean for
delta u in path A?

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.010
Zero right?

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.870
Ideal gas, no temperature
change, right has to be zero

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:19.920
because da is Cv dT for an ideal
gas. dT is zero, there's

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.800
no temperature change.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:31.540
OK, how about delta H, zero
Cp dT for an ideal gas.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.530
dT is zero.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.370
All right, now, it's
reversible.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.570
So that means we can immediately
write down an

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.170
expression for the work.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:53.960
Since it's reversible, it's
negative p dV right?

00:08:53.960 --> 00:09:00.810
And since it's an ideal gas then
we can replace p, right,

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.010
with RT over V, right?

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.500
We want to do that because we
have too many variables here.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.130
We've already got dV we'll get
rid of p as an additional

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:18.590
variable and replace it with
V which is already in here.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:27.520
So it's minus R T1
dV over V, right?

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:33.060
I can put in T1 because we're a
constant temperature. so now

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.260
we can just integrate straight
away and find that the work in

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:44.160
path A it's just the integral
of that quantity minus

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:54.430
integral of R T1 going from V1
to V2 dV over V. so it's minus

00:09:54.430 --> 00:10:02.550
R T1 log V2 over V1.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.070
All right, so let's just do
a reality check here.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.550
The way I've got this
drawn, the volume is

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.880
going up in the process.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.210
It's an expansion.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.660
So is this system doing work
on the surroundings, or are

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:25.730
the surroundings doing
work on the system?

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.230
Somebody say it real loud.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.210
Yes, the system is working on
the surroundings, right?

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.810
It's pushing out against them.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.890
Work is defined as the work that
the surroundings do on

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.760
the system.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.660
So this is the negative
number, right?

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.250
V2 is bigger than V1.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.060
This is positive.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.650
This whole thing is negative.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:56.220
All right, q has to be just the
opposite of this because

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.870
we've already figured out that
there's no change in u.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.470
This is just q plus w.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:12.520
There's w, q has to be R
T1 log of V2 over V1.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:20.960
OK, so that means heat is being
imparted to the system,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.170
right, from the surroundings in
a manner that compensates

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.780
exactly the amount
of work done.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.350
OK, All right, so these are the
thermodynamic quantities

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.010
that you're familiar
with already.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:43.420
Let's just quickly look at
our special function.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.320
It's not going to be hard to
calculate because it's a

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.550
constant temperature path,
so that T in the

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.280
bottom is just T1, right.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.060
You've already looked
at q, right.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:20.830
So dq A over T1 it's just
R log V2 over V1 right.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.470
So there's our special
function for

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.980
this particular path.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:41.770
OK, so that's path A. Now let's
compare to path B. So if

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:49.260
path B is an adibat, what's
zero? q, it's adiabatic, that

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.470
means there's no heat exchanged
between the system

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.040
and the surroundings.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:08.480
So what happens, q B is zero.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.600
There is a change in
temperature, right?

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.650
We've got, if we say it's a mole
of gas, it's going from

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:32.450
p1, V1, and T1 to one mole of
our gas at p3, V2, and T2.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.560
So unlike before now

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.920
temperature is going to change.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:43.680
So that means that delta
u isn't zero this time.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.140
du, it's an ideal gas.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:52.110
So this is Cv dT and of course
we can just integrate this

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.370
straight away.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:14:09.740
So delta u B is Cv times T2
minus T1, right. and similarly

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:15.730
dH is Cp dT right.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:29.940
So delta H in pathway B is
just Cp T2 minus T1 okay?

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.040
All right, what we've already
got that q is zero.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.860
Delta u is q plus w.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.340
Delta u isn't zero.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:49.780
So this must be equal
to work, right?

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.680
And now we can look at our
special function, but since

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:58.840
this is zero right dq B is zero,
along path B, so our

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:09.594
special function, dS, so we're
going to go, dq B over T is

00:15:09.594 --> 00:15:12.330
equal to zero.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:21.450
OK?

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:27.400
OK, finally let's look at our
third path, this constant

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:33.540
volume path, that's going to
connect T1 and T2, right?

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:41.450
Constant volume, what's zero?

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:41.800
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.460
PROFESSOR NELSON: A little
more noise here.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.160
What's zero?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.270
STUDENT: Work.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.170
PROFESSOR NELSON: Work, great.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:16:02.260
So, path C constant volume means
our work in past C is

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.420
zero, right?

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:11.680
Now, our temperature is going
to change from T2 to T1, and

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.170
we just saw what happens to u
and H when that happens going

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.840
from T1 to T2, and it's
no different.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.410
It's an ideal gas going
along these path.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:25.150
So we can immediately write
delta u C is Cv

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.190
times T1 minus T2.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:40.220
Delta Hc C is Cp times
T1 minus T2, right?

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.580
Work is zero.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.390
Delta u is w plus q,
work plus heat.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.540
This is zero, this isn't.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:55.550
This must be heat q B, right.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.980
So again, there are our
familiar thermodynamic

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:04.300
quantities, but now let's also
look at our special function.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.080
It's not going to be zero this
time because we have non zero

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.090
heat exchange between
the system and the

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:12.990
environment, right.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:25.980
So are integral of dq C over T,
right, which is our heat,

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.700
but in this case we can do
this calculation easily

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:36.960
because since work is zero, we
can equate dq with du, right.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:44.240
So we can write this as our
integral from T1 to T2, du

00:17:44.240 --> 00:18:06.330
over T. du is just
Cv dT, right.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:15.480
So this is just Cv
log T2 over T1.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.510
OK?

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:26.750
So now we've completed
the cycle.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.280
So let's just compare.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:34.510
Let's compare what happened in
path A to what happened in

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:43.030
paths B and C. Yes?

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:43.740
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.250
PROFESSOR NELSON: Ah sorry,
yes of course.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:56.360
Thank you.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:04.630
Yes, oh yes, so.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.940
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.600
PROFESSOR NELSON: And it's
right because, thank you

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.930
again, it's because we're
going from T1 to T2.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:17.270
So I'm getting confused
by the oh sorry, we're

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.880
going from T2 to T1.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.810
So it's in reverse of the order
of the subscripts and I

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.850
let this confuse me.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.870
There it is.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:37.510
There it is.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.200
There.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.670
Thank you, any other details
which should be pointed out?

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.150
All right, then let's proceed.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.670
So what we're going to do is
our comparison of what

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:54.790
happened on pathway A to what
happened in combined pathways

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.780
B and C, right?

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:07.700
So here are results for pathway
A, right, for delta u

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.850
zero delta H zero.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:18.210
I didn't actually explicitly
write it or did I?

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.440
Let's just write it again.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:27.133
Here's our work in path A, and
here's our heat exchange in

00:20:27.133 --> 00:20:40.820
path A. Now let's look at the
sum of B and C. So B plus C,

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:48.210
here is delta uB Cv
times T2 minus T1.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:57.380
Delta uC Cv times T1 minus T2,
the sum is zero right.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.840
That's the some of delta u in
these two paths, and if we

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.390
look at delta u in just
path A, it's zero.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.660
And it's going to be the same
without delta H. The only

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.920
difference is it'll be Cp
instead of Cv, but there it is

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:18.110
for pathway B. There it is for
a pathway C. So the state

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:22.250
functions that we're familiar
with are doing what we expect

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.470
they ought to be doing, right?

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.830
If you go around in a cycle,
starting and ending at the

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.730
same place, the state functions

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:30.660
have to stay the same.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.890
They only depend on the state
the system is in.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.320
They don't depend on the
path, and that's what

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.150
we've shown, right.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.320
Similarly if we go from this
point to this point through

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.290
path A or if we do it through
the combination of these two

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.790
paths, and the change in u and H
in any state function, those

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:49.660
have to be the same.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.990
It turns out they're zero in
both cases, and that's what

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.260
we've seen, right?

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:01.360
Now let's compare what happens
to work and heat.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.160
So here are expressions
for work and heat.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:12.615
They're opposites for the
pathway A. Here's pathway B

00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:17.960
and C. In C the work is zero.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:24.920
In B it isn't, it's Cv times
T2 minus T1, right.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:31.910
The work isn't equal to the
work in pathway A, right,

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.050
because you know work is not a
state function it depends on

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.890
the path right, and there are
different amounts of work done

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:44.420
on the system, or done by the
system on the surroundings in

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.190
these two different processes.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.150
They're both expansions.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.510
They'll both have net work done
on the surroundings, but

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.080
not the same amount, right.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.830
And of course it's going to
be the same with heat.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.360
We've already seen that
delta u is zero.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.920
So we know that in each case
the heat is going to be the

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.050
opposite of the work, but the
work isn't the same in these

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:08.950
two different ways of getting
from here to here, right.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.640
So let's just see
it explicitly.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.340
Here's our qA.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:18.460
Here's heat exchanged in pathway
A and in pathway B

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.810
heat is zero, and in pathway
C, here is qC

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:27.110
it's Cv T1 minus T2.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.980
So again, for both heat
and work we don't

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.570
get the same result.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.630
Now let's look at our special
function, right.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:42.670
So here's path A. We found that
it's R log V2 over V1.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.770
Pathway B is zero.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:53.620
Pathway C it's Cv
log T1 over T2.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:24:08.930
All right, let's just look at
that a little more carefully.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:12.500
R log V2 over V1.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:31.940
B plus C, Cv log of
T1 over T2, right.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:37.340
Just some weird combination
of functions, right?

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.550
But, of course, it's not
quite like that.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.410
Why?

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:50.520
Because this path is
an adiabatic path.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.530
And you already saw last time
there was this relationship

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:59.360
between the temperature and
volume changes along an

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.000
adiabatic path.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.620
So let me just write
that down.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:16.830
Adiabatic reversible path.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:27.110
What you saw is that T1 over
T2 was V2 over V1 to the

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:32.310
power R over Cv.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.340
Isn't that something?

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.780
So what does that mean?

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:45.590
We take this Cv and put in
the exponent here, right.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:50.290
And we put this R up in
the exponent here.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:51.740
What are we going to discover?

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:58.790
Those two things are equal
right, T1 over T2 to the power

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:10.380
Cv is V2 over V1 to the power R,
so dS over path A equals dS

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:17.570
over paths B plus C, okay?

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:23.120
So what this suggests is that
whatever this funny special

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.700
function is, at least for this
one cycle that we've, tried

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.440
it's behaving like a state
function, right.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.400
It seems like its change
is independent of path.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.970
Start here, end up here, do
it through two different

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:45.480
pathways, end up in the
same place, right.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.120
OK, now that's all the
foreshadowing I'm going to

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.220
give it for right now.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.500
We will certainly come
back to this very

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.720
special function shortly.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.520
Before I move on, I'm just
going to put on the board

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.250
another cycle, and I'm going
to urge you to work through

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:05.080
that on your own.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.230
It's worked through already,
let's see, I believe it's

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:17.720
worked through in
the notes, yes.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.210
So if you need the help of the
notes it's in there, but I

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:26.020
would urge you to work through
it on your own, and it's the

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:49.190
following: let's start with the
same path A, all right?

00:27:49.190 --> 00:28:00.480
So we've got our reversible
adiabatic path right.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:06.190
And now, try working through
what happens if we close the

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.530
cycle in a different way,
right, like this.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:18.310
So here's a path that's constant
pressure, and here is

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:24.140
a path that's constant volume,
similar to the constant volume

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.280
path that we did before, but
not between the same

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.440
pressures, right.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:37.460
So we can label this one D and
this one E, and I urge you to

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.500
just try going through that
and verifying for yourself

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.760
that again the state functions
will behave the way state

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.760
functions should, and you can
see whether this special

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.880
function once again behaves like
a state function, right.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.270
And of course you should expect
to see that the work

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.540
and the heat again won't behave
like state functions

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.850
which they are, then you'll see
you have different results

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:07.420
for those, depending
on the path, OK?

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:12.140
Any questions about going
through these cycles and using

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.770
expressions like this
and so forth?

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:20.310
Expressions like this you know
turn up in various places,

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.980
like in the equations sheet
that appears at the end of

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.650
exams, right?

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.960
Which means that you
may not need to be

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.410
committing it to memory.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.080
On the other hand it means that
you should, it's the sort

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.490
of thing that you should be
familiar with so that the need

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:40.610
to use it is something that
you'll conjure when you're

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:43.260
working on a problem and there's
a reversible adiabat,

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.870
and you have temperatures and
volumes that change that you

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:53.170
might like to relate
to each other.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:56.750
Cycles that are suggested that
you go through and aren't gone

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.350
through in class also sometimes
turn up on exams

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.770
too, by the way.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:06.270
So that said, let's move on to
the next topic, which is

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.180
thermochemistry.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:14.170
So, so far what you've seen in
most of the examples in the

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:19.080
class are essentially mechanical
kinds of changes,

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.240
pressure volume sorts of
changes, where the system is

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.960
doing essentially a kind of
mechanical work, pressure

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.580
volume work on the surroundings
or vice versa and

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.110
heat is being exchanged, and
you're calculating the basic

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.385
thermodynamics just like
we went through, of

00:30:33.385 --> 00:30:36.250
processes of that sort.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:40.230
Now I'd like to start
introducing something that's

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.760
really central to chemical
thermodynamics, mainly

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.420
chemistry, right.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.550
Let's start looking at chemical
reactions, right, and

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:53.870
understanding what the changes
in thermodynamic properties

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:57.170
are that occur when chemical
reactions occur, and the

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:01.490
immediate application is to
calculate the change in

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.480
enthalpy, which, as you've seen
it, at constant pressure

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.200
which is the condition under
which an awful lot of

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.420
chemistry is done, that's
just the heat.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.755
Which means we're going
to calculate heats

00:31:13.755 --> 00:31:16.310
of reaction, right.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.520
You're running some reaction.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.260
It's in the atmosphere.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.140
It's at constant pressure.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.220
You know, you mix acid and base
together and the thing

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.400
heats up like crazy, right.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.600
Or other things might
react spontaneously.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.700
You can feel something
cooling off right.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.155
I mean simple examples of these
happen when you, you

00:31:34.155 --> 00:31:36.350
know, if you buy cold
or hot packs.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.940
You break the seal between them
and feel the thing get

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.780
cold, for example, right.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.770
What's happening there?

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.730
Well, the selection of reactants
has been done

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:50.680
judiciously to provide either
heat or to provide something

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.890
that's cool.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:56.530
And all of that is coming out
of the heat of reaction,

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.450
whether it's positive
or negative.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:02.130
Of course the biggest practical
application is

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.580
burning of fuel.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:08.570
You might use the heat to, and
convert it into pressure

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:10.640
volume work, right?

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.060
So if it's an internal
combustion

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.870
engine, you'll do a reaction.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.820
There will be the heat
of reaction.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.640
There'll be a volume change,
depending on the conditions

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.990
under which is occurs, and you
can extract work through the

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.500
reaction and so forth.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.410
So let's just to see how you
run through some of those

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.350
calculations.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:34.120
Now let me just ask who
here took 5.111?

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.910
And who here took 5.112?

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:43.950
OK, now you've seen some
thermal chemistry

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.040
in 5.111 and 5.112.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.590
So I I'm going to do some review
of that, but I'm also

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.270
going to call on the
thermochemistry that I'm

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.700
pretty sure you're
familiar with.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.000
So I won't go painstakingly
over every element of the

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.830
notes here.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:02.350
Subsequently we'll go on into
additional topics that you

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:24.520
haven't seen, and I'll treat
them in full detail.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:33.690
OK, so let's do some
thermochemistry.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.910
What we want to do is we'd like
to be able to predict for

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:43.720
any reaction what's the
heat of reaction.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:59.140
And so what we're going to
calculator is delta H. So for

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:03.920
any kind of reaction we should
be able to do that, right?

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:09.080
And we're going to treat
constant pressure situations

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:17.090
certainly at first and most
of the time, right?

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:32.030
Constant pressure, right,
reversible delta H is going to

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:37.840
give us our heat of
reaction, OK.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:44.600
And then if we can also
determine delta u, then we

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:50.412
know this, we know delta u
is q plus w, then we can

00:34:50.412 --> 00:35:07.710
determine work as well, right?

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:14.270
And typically, we'll be treating
at least some cases

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.670
where we're dealing with ideal
gases in which case we can

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:20.160
easily get delta u.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.080
And then we'll be able
to in a very

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.960
straightforward way get w.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:30.030
So it's a really powerful and
simple formalism, once we set

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:34.050
up what is needed the go
through it, right?

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:56.400
So let's just consider
any reaction.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.300
The one that I've got written
down for you is it's the

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.070
reverse of the rusting
of iron, right?

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:07.390
So iron left to own devices in
the atmosphere in the presence

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.210
of a little bit of water, and
the atmosphere will start

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.970
combining with the water
form iron oxide.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.810
There's an equilibrium
between the two.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:19.830
So we'll have an iron
oxide species.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:27.740
It's a solid.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:38.110
It's combining with hydrogen
which is a gas to give iron,

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:49.180
also a solid and water, right?

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.110
So the way I've written this
we're imagining the iron, the

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:57.020
solid iron immersed in the water
as a liquid, could be

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.510
calculated otherwise as well,
but in this case were imaging

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:03.810
the water as liquid and going
in this direction then it's

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:12.390
forming iron oxide and evolving
hydrogen gas, okay?

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:21.690
And our heat of reaction or
enthalpy of reaction is

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:26.190
defined as the enthalpy
at constant pressure.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:31.410
Isothermal conditions,
temperature won't change and

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:38.480
reversible work.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:49.850
For Isothermal reaction
constant

00:37:49.850 --> 00:38:00.230
pressure reversible, right?

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.390
Of course, they're all sorts
of conditions under which a

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.640
reaction could be wrong
in the lab or

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:08.330
outdoors or however, right.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:09.350
But this is the way
we're going to

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:11.650
define delta H of reaction.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.830
We want to have that definition
clear because in

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.750
fact we're going to, we might
want tabulate heats of

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:19.360
reaction, right, and of course
want to know what the

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:23.980
conditions are for the tabulated
values apply.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.050
And we're going to want to
calculate them from other

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.300
quantities, and again, we're
going to need to know each

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.790
case what are the relevant
conditions?

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:37.090
OK, so what happens?

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.910
Well, we should be
able to get this.

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:44.100
We should be able to
calculate delta H.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.770
It's a state function.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:55.410
If we know the enthalpy of the
products minus the enthalpy of

00:38:55.410 --> 00:39:00.520
the reactants, right.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:05.400
It's a state function.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.280
And we can we can do this in
principle except for one

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.450
important detail, which is
that enthalpy, just like

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:19.120
energy u isn't measured on an
absolute scale but on a

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.550
relative scale, right?

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.310
You know, if you want to measure
the potential energy

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.820
of something in a gravitational
field, you have

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.090
to define the zero somewhere,
right, because it's arbitrary.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.120
You can set it anywhere
you want.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.030
It's the same with enthalpy.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:39.890
Enthalpy is just u plus p V. So
there is an arbitrary set

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:43.690
point that needs to
be defined, right?

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:47.250
Because what you actually
measure in the lab are changes

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:51.420
in enthalpy, just like what you
measure when you look at

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.350
energy change of some sort,
you measure the change in

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:55.960
energy, right.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.010
The absolute number that you
assign to it is something

00:39:59.010 --> 00:39:59.880
that's arbitrary.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.260
You have to set what
the zero is.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:07.450
And so there's a well-understood
convention for

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.010
what the zero is.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:17.290
What we define as zero is the
enthalpy of every element in

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.310
its natural state at room

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:21.560
temperature and ambient pressure.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:26.780
In other words, we choose a
convention for the zero of

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:30.330
entropy, so that then we can
write entropies of products

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:35.660
and reactants always referring
to the same standard state.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:41.920
And then we calculate changes,
the convention is understood

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.330
with respect to what
is the zero, right.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.800
And so our tabulated values,
they'll all work.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.000
They'll all refer to the
same standard state.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.230
And we'll be able to use the
formalism that we set up.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:41:36.030
So our reference point for H,
it's 298.15 Kelvin, one bar

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:44.730
and in that standard state our
molar enthalpy is defined as

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:59.260
zero for every element
in its stable form.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:05.410
OK, very important.

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:14.450
OK, now, given that reference
point, all we need to do to

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:18.870
get the value of enthalpy that
we're going to use for each

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:25.280
reactant and each product is
calculate how much does the

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:31.730
enthalpy change to form it from
the elements in their

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.370
stable form at room temperature

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:37.540
and pressure, right.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.160
So we're going to replace the H
or we're going to put in for

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.050
the H what we'll call our heat
of formation or delta H of

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:49.260
formation starting from the
elements in their stable

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.580
states at room temperature
and pressure, for

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.500
each of these things.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:57.440
And we can do that because now
we're going to have instead of

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.650
just sort of H, it's going to
be delta H of formation for

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.570
each of these things, is going
to appear in our calculation

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.040
of H, but that's OK.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:11.310
Delta H of formation means the
enthalpy of this compound

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:16.720
minus the enthalpy of its
constituent elements in their

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.440
most stable state at room
temperature and pressure.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.160
But we've defined the enthalpy
of those elements in their

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.930
stable state at room temperature
and pressure as

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:29.800
zero, right?

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.930
So we're just subtracting, in
effect, zero, right, from the

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:37.160
enthalpy of the product, but of
course it's important have

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.070
that established because the
heat of formation is something

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.120
you could measure, right?

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:46.050
You could run the reaction,
take solid iron, gaseous

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:51.880
oxygen, form iron oxide, measure
the heat of formation

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.680
of it, tabulate it.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.420
We know it.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.440
We know it forever, right.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.080
And for any of the
other compounds.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.960
So in other words, by defining
that reference state, we can

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:11.390
then figure out or measure heats
of formation of a vast

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:13.370
number of compounds.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:14.450
We can tabulate them.

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:17.250
We can know them, and then when
we have reactions that

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.920
inter-convert different
compounds, we can calculate

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.256
the heat of reaction is just
the difference between the

00:44:23.256 --> 00:44:26.260
heat of formation of the
reactants, and the heat of

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.720
formation of the products,
right.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:37.300
So let's just write that out.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:48.080
So first of all, for example,
right, molar enthalpy of

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:57.950
hydrogen gas at 298.15
K is zero.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:03.310
Hydrogen gas it's in its most
stable state, right at room

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:04.470
temperature and pressure.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:10.370
That little zero, that
little superscript

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:17.290
means one bar always.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:17.810
OK.

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:33.750
A molar enthalpy of or whatever,
iron, as a solid at

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:38.030
298.15 Kelvin is zero.

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:42.660
Iron as an element is a solid.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.220
That's it's most stable state
at room temperature and

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:52.580
pressure, right, and so on.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.290
And then we can figure out
heats of formation.

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:59.440
Now in this particular reaction,
I've got hydrogen

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.290
gas, iron solid.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:07.380
Those already are elements in
their most stable forms at

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.200
room temperature and pressure.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.880
But this is a compound, right,
it has some non-zero heat of

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.400
formation from the elements.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.940
So is water, right?

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.470
So I need to find out the heats
of formation of the iron

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:26.500
oxide and the water.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.470
And if I do that then I can
find out the change in

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:31.120
enthalpy of this reaction.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:36.440
It's just going to be the heat
of formation of these three

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.990
moles of water, minus
the heat of

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:42.180
formation of the iron oxide.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:48.340
OK.

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.270
So how am I going to do that?

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:54.920
Well, I need to write the
reaction that forms that

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.220
compound from it's
elements, right?

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:00.930
And I want to tabulate that
for an enormous number of

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:02.890
materials, right?

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:10.160
So for example, if I want to
look at HBr, there's a simple

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:18.640
case, right, hydrogen bromine.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.480
What's my heat of formation?

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.900
Delta Hf.

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:28.420
It's going to have our
little zero, right?

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.610
How do I calculate it?

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:33.040
Well, I need to write the
reaction that forms this from

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.140
its constituent elements.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:36.960
What is it?

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:48.010
Well, 1/2 H2 as a gas,
temperature, at one bar, plus

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:56.390
1/2 bromine, no actually bromine
is a liquid at room

00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:00.430
temperature and one
atmosphere.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:07.440
They form HBr which is a gas
at room temperature and one

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.050
bar, right.

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:17.370
I can measure that.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:25.220
And the heat of reaction for
this, delta H of reaction is

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:36.520
equal to delta H of formation,
of HBr as a gas at our

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:42.500
temperature and one bar, okay?

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.900
So that's how we determine
our heats of formation.

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:53.670
We measure them for all
these compounds.

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:58.570
And then we go back to reactions
like this, and we

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:12.330
can just very simply determine
the heat of reaction because

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:26.350
all we're doing is the
following cycle.

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:37.180
We go from reactants to products
and there's some heat

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:42.960
of reaction, and here's the
cycle that we have.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.790
We go to the elements
in their standard

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:57.460
states, in both cases.

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:10.000
So we're really just doing our
delta H is the negative sum of

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:16.260
delta H of formation for the
reactants, all right?

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:23.330
Because here what we're doing
is we're going to take apart

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:27.210
our reactants and form the
elements from them, right?

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.880
So written this way, for
example, I'm going to pull

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.460
these things apart, and I'm
going to have solid iron, and

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:36.270
I'm going to have gaseous
oxygen, and I know the

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:38.780
enthalpy of that reaction.

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:42.005
That's just given by the heat of
formation, the enthalpy of

00:50:42.005 --> 00:50:43.060
formation of iron oxide.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:50.680
Here, now I'm going to take
those same elements, and I'm

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.610
going to make the
products, right.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.180
I know it's going to work
because I already had this

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.370
reaction, so all the, you know,
I'm going to conserve

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.380
atoms in the right way.

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:03.780
So here, I'm going to have delta
H, is just the sum for

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:10.500
all the products of delta heat
of formation, right?

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:17.500
Here I'm going to put together
all the products.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.830
So this is a positive
heat of formation.

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.560
This is the negative heat
of formation, right?

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.440
In other words, I've
got reactants,

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.560
and I've got products.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.510
What's delta H of reaction?

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:32.040
It's delta H of formation of the
products minus delta H of

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.770
formation of the reactants.

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:42.490
That's the important message,
delta H of formation of the

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:54.340
products, minus delta H of
formation of the reactants.

00:51:54.340 --> 00:52:00.070
Any questions?

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:03.600
All right, tomorrow I'll go
through the remaining details.

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:08.110
The truth is after this, it's
all arithmetic, right?

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:09.750
We're just going to
go through it and

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:11.660
execute it a little bit.

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.200
And then we'll move on and talk
about how we'd actually

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.840
make some of these measurements
of delta H and

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.130
compare them to what
we calculate.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.810
See you tomorrow.
