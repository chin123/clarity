00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.450
PROFESSOR: And today I'll
continue with both ideal and

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.830
non-ideal, or real,
liquid mixtures.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.850
And let me just say the reason
we're in some sense lavishing

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.670
so much attention on this topic
is because, after all,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.340
there's just an enormous amount
of chemistry that

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.690
happens in liquid mixtures.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.070
Awful lot of biology.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.890
Awful lot of just processing
of stuff.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.240
Distillation and everything
else.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.940
So there's so much chemistry
that takes place in liquid

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.300
mixtures that it is really
important to have a sense of

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.375
what the free energy and
chemical potential of each of

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:51.110
the species is doing in there.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.250
Because of course this is what
directly guides the chemistry

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.140
that happens.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.970
So I just want to start by
finishing up something, a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.880
couple of things, from the
topics from the last lecture.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.140
One of them is, I derived an
expression for the lever rule.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.900
And I just wanted to
make a little more

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.850
explicit the result.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.650
It may not have been
completely clear.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.750
So, I just want to
go back to that.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:33.810
We had looked at what happens
if you start at some

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.710
particular point, labeled one,
and work your way up.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.300
So we're raising the pressure.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.730
So we're in the all gas
region to start.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.230
All gas region of the
phase diagram.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.920
This is xB and yB.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.240
The liquid and gas mole
fractions of B. And the idea

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.290
is that here is our
initial value.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.670
Now we're only in
the gas phase.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.520
There is no liquid.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.050
So this is yB of one.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.460
There is no xB at this point.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.360
We raise the pressure.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.470
And at some point, depending on
where we end, we then look

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.750
to both coexistence curves to
determine the compositions of

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.400
both the liquid and
the gas phases.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.620
So when we look out here,
at the liquid phase.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.220
That gives us xB.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.030
At where I labeled point two, so
there's two after we raise

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.450
the pressure.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.530
We started at one.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.670
And then over here, we look at
the gas phase coexistence

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.190
curve. so there's our yB
value at two, right?

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.620
And I derived an expression for
the ratio of the number of

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.130
moles in the gas and
liquid phases.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.340
Because the idea here is, let's
say you're working your

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.840
way up on the curve.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.820
If you just barely get to the
coexistence curve, of course

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.230
then you could see how
much material you've

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.780
got in the two phases.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.910
But there's very little
material still.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.910
You've still got almost
everything in the gas phase

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.370
when you first reach here.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.580
And as you work your way up in
pressure, you'd have more and

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.200
more liquid.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.250
Of course, if you were to just
keep going, you'd get into the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.340
pure liquid phase.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.190
Typically, though, you might
stop somewhere in the middle

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.110
and have some reasonable amount
of material in both

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.210
phases, and you want
to find out the

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.930
composition in each phase.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.560
And also, want to know
how much material

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.700
there is in each phase.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.100
So the result that I derived
was n gas at two

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.620
over n liquid at two.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.040
The ratio of total moles in
the gas to the liquid.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.820
What I derived was xA of
two minus yA of one.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.410
Over yA of one.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.000
Minus yA of two, and I just want
to, in some sense, finish

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.170
up by making the obvious
substitution, which is, of

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.300
course these are
mole fractions.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.660
So I can just write xA
is one minus xB.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.540
And yA is one minus yB.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.990
And I just want to put this in
the terms that are written

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.200
here in the phase diagram.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.480
When I got to this result I
pointed out that therefore you

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.590
can use the lever rule.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.110
And I just want to make that
a little bit more explicit.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.950
So using that relation, then we
can see that ng of two over

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.360
nl of two, total number of moles
in the gas to the liquid

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.280
is, now I'm going to substitute
in to get yB of one

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:57.860
minus xB of two over yB of
two minus yB of one.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.300
So all I've done here is
substitute in these

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.200
expressions.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.500
And now I'm going to just
switch both of these.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.750
And so I'm going to multiply
both sides by negative one.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:19.340
So I can write xB of two minus
yB of one over yB of

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.980
one minus yB of two.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.390
So that's the result
that I want.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.160
Because if I look at the two
segments of this line, on

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.930
either side of the pressure
value I've reached, then what

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:43.050
I see, of course, is that
over here I've got xB of

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.590
two minus yB of one.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.980
That's this.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:06:17.360
And this part is yB of
one minus yB of two.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.450
That is, it's this part.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.290
And that's here.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.590
And so that's the point, is that
the ratio of moles in the

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.250
gas and liquid phases is just
given by the two segments of

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.420
this on either side.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.510
And so what this allows us to
see very simply is alright,

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.320
I'm going to raise the pressure
at some point.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.340
And depending on how much
material I feel like I need to

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.530
collect in the new phase, I
can always determine that

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.290
simply by reading off the phase
diagram what the ratio

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:56.710
of these two segment
lengths is.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.180
Now what I want to do.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.530
What what we've done mostly is
just go through these phase

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.630
diagrams, see how
to read them.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.570
How to follow events on them
as you change pressure in a

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.610
diagram like this.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.110
Or change temperature
in diagrams like I

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.430
also showed last time.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.430
Now what I'd like to do is go a
little bit further and just

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.650
look at expressions for the
chemical potential and the

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.230
free energies.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.410
So that we can, a little more
quantitatively, see

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.260
what's going on.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.560
So let's just see what's
happening.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:45.380
So let's look at the chemical
potentials.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:51.900
In ideal liquid mixtures.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:08:00.730
So everything is derived from
the fact that when we have any

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.020
of the constituents in both
phases, the chemical potential

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.950
must be equal in both phases.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.950
Right?

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:12.420
So, we can write for A, mu
A of the liquid at some

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:18.720
temperature and pressure must
equal chemical potential of A

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.010
for the gas.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:27.150
That's the partial pressure.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.315
So if we have an ideal gas, and
certainly if we're going

00:08:31.315 --> 00:08:34.450
to assume an ideal liquid
mixture, we can safely assume

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.680
that it's an ideal
gas above it.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.300
Then we can write
mu A in the gas.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.960
Is just mu A naught.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.380
That's a function of the
temperature plus RT

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.800
log of pA over p0.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.430
Nothing new here, this is just
our expression for the

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.560
chemical potential in the
gas, with reference

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.080
to a standard potential.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.420
Usually one bar.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.190
At whatever the temperature
is.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.350
And, of course, this is how it
varies as the partial pressure

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.340
of A in the gas phase varies.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:31.410
So then we can just write our
expression for the liquid.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:38.220
At our temperature and pressure,
it's given by mu

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.370
naught in the gas phase.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.690
Plus RT log pA over p0.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.580
So it's the same thing.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.610
Because I'm just taking
advantage of this equality.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.270
But of course, this is
an obvious step,

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.040
having written this.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.150
But is a super important step.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.980
That's what allows us to do
this treatment in such a

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.080
straightforward way.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.120
We know a lot about the
chemical potential of

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.230
something in the gas phase.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.800
Since the gas and liquid are in
equilibrium, therefore we

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:24.870
know the chemical potential
in the liquid phase too.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.870
So we can rewrite this by
recognizing that if we just go

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:37.100
to the limit where we only have
pure liquid A, so pure

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:45.680
liquid A. Well, in that case, mu
A naught or sorry, mu A in

00:10:45.680 --> 00:11:00.400
the liquid phase, mu A star is
mu A naught in the gas phase.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:08.880
Plus RT log pA over p0.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:16.750
And so for the mixture, now all
I'm going to do is just

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.040
add and subtract terms.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:25.450
So we can write mu A in the
liquid at T and p, right?

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.560
So this is in the case of the
limit of the pure liquid.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.030
Now we're going to
the mixture.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:48.930
So it's just mu A naught plus
RT log pA star over p0 minus

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:54.230
RT log of pA star over p0.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:03.610
Wait a minute, lost a term.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:12.690
Plus RT log pA over p0.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.670
And all I want to do now
is combine terms.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:22.740
To write mu A star liquid
temperature and pressure.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:30.730
Plus RT log of pA
over pA star.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.900
So this is a very convenient
form for it.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.570
And then, of course, we have an
expression for pA, right?

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:49.440
From Raoult's law. pA
is just the mole

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.870
fraction xA times pA star.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.880
That's just true for
the ideal mixture.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:08.320
So now, finally, we can write
that mu A in the liquid at T

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:16.220
and p is just given
by mu A star.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.400
So that's for the pure
liquid at that

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.530
temperature and pressure.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:25.970
Plus RT log of the mole fraction
of A. So that's a

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:33.240
very simple expression for the
chemical potential of A. And

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.000
of course the analogous
expression will hold for any

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.120
of the constituents.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:43.700
In an ideal liquid mixture.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.850
By the way, it's convenient
because it looks just like the

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.000
chemical potential in a mixture
of ideal gases.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:59.210
Except that we have liquid
instead of gases, right?

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.100
Now, of course, since this is
a mole fraction, it's always

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.180
between zero and one.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:09.870
That means this is always
a negative number.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:16.090
So what that means is that the
chemical potential in the

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:21.190
solution is always lower than
the chemical potential of the

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:57.650
pure liquid.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.430
Very important result.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.910
So it has all sorts of
implications that we'll see.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.860
One of them is osmotic
pressure.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:11.050
It means that if I have a
biological cell, or some

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.240
container with a membrane
through which one of the

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.520
constituents might pass.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.230
So in other words, the let's
say, component A, maybe it's

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.930
just water.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.520
It can pass freely, let's say,
from the outside to the inside

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.040
of the cell, or from one side
to another of a membrane.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.570
And on one side I've just
got pure water.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.340
And on the other I've got saline
solution or whatever is

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.650
in the cells, right?

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.130
What's the water going to
do in that situation?

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.710
What's going to happen?

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.970
Anybody know?

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:50.380
So I've got, I just take fresh
cells and plunk them into pure

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.330
water solution.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.510
What happens?

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:56.730
Yeah.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.020
They burst.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.610
Water rushes in.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.720
Because the chemical potential
is lower inside.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.260
It's always lower in solution
than outside.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.490
So water rushes in, and
the membrane expands.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.800
Now, if the membrane is
strong enough, at some

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.300
point it may not burst.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.560
And the pressure might
start to go up.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.400
Let's say the membrane
is strong enough to

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.260
resist and not burst.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.190
Eventually, the water won't keep
going in indefinitely.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:30.040
That's because it won't be at
the same temperature and

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.730
pressure any more.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.510
In particular, the pressure
will have changed.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.990
So you can build up some high
pressure, what's called

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.620
osmotic pressure.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.540
Because of the fact that at the
same pressure the chemical

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.730
potential of the water's lower
inside the cell or inside the

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.780
enclosure with the membrane.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.140
So water will keep filling.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.170
And at some point the chemical
potentials will equalize

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.880
because of the change
in pressure.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.440
And at that point there'll be
an equilibrium established.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.990
We'll see that quantitatively
a little bit later.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.630
OK.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:13.160
The other thing to notice is,
this is familiar from the

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.820
expression for a gas mixture.

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.850
What drives the gas mixture?

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.840
Remember back when we discussed
mixing of gases and

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.220
the fact that they
would mix at all.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.450
What makes that happen?

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.070
What's driving it?

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.050
Yeah, it's entropy, right?

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.580
And that's what's happening
here too.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.030
Of course, in the case of the
ideal liquid mixture, there's

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.070
no energetic interaction.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.440
The molecules are
non-interacting in this case.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.220
But of course, entropy is going
to want them to mix.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.950
And that's what's
resulting in the

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:50.070
decrease in chemical potential.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.440
Let's see that a little more
explicitly by just calculating

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.610
out the free energy
change of mixing.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:02.510
So, delta G of mixing.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:15.580
So we're going to start with
two separated liquids.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.050
And then we'll remove
the barrier.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:26.940
And we'll have the two
mixed together.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.900
So of course, the free energy in
either case is just the sum

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.670
of the number of moles of
each times the chemical

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:35.710
potential of each.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.910
We have expressions for that.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:42.160
So starting G1 in this case.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.030
It's n of A, number of
moles of A. Times

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.930
the chemical potential.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:58.780
So it's xA mu A star
in the liquid.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:08.830
Plus nB xB B mu B star
of the liquid.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.300
Here, G of two.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.590
After we let them mix.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:21.270
Then it's n -- wait a minute.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:26.110
It's just n.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.220
I think I've got that wrong
in the notes also.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.860
Right, it's just a number of
moles times the chemical

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.410
potential in each case.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:37.880
So it's the number of
moles times xA.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:43.600
Times mu A in the mixture.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:52.660
Plus n xB mu B in the mixture.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.620
But we've just figured it out
our expressions for mu A and

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.930
mu B, our chemical potentials
of each constituent in the

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.040
ideal liquid mixture.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:11.690
So this is just n xA.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.940
And here's our expression.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.250
And of course these are
going to cancel.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.780
Let's write it out.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:27.910
So it's mu A star
plus RT log xA.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:37.820
And then, mu B star
plus RT log xB.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.890
So our delta G of mixing
is just the difference

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.670
between these two.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:58.730
So it's n RT xA log
xA plus xB log xB.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.570
Where have you seen
that before?

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:03.720
Yeah.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.710
The same thing that you had for
the delta G of mixing for

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.330
an ideal gas mixture.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:10.700
Why?

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.890
Because we're not accounting for
any interactions between

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.640
the molecules in either
of the phases.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:22.690
And if the molecules aren't
interacting, it's all entropy.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.770
And the entropy term has the
same form in either case.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.780
In microscopic terms, it's just
measuring the fact that

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.460
there's more disorder
in the mixture

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.860
than in the pure liquids.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:45.955
Just the same it was
in the gas phase.

00:21:45.955 --> 00:21:49.710
OK.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:55.490
We can see this even more
explicitly if we just recall

00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:00.980
that G is V dp minus S dT.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.710
So we can just explicitly
calculate

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.060
the entropy of mixing.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:13.110
Delta S of mixing is just the
partial of delta G of mixing.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:17.360
Negative partial.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.130
With respect to temperature.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.700
At constant pressure.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:30.180
So it's just minus n R xA
log xA plus xB log xB.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.930
So that's our entropy
of mixing.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.470
We can calculate our
enthalpy of mixing.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.550
Just delta G of mixing.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.380
Plus T delta S of mixing.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.630
But it's immediately apparent
that these are just going to

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.630
cancel when we multiply
this by T. So there's

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.970
no enthalpy of mixing.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.220
Just as we expect when
there are no

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.560
energetic terms involved.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:06.170
It's all entropy that's
driving the mixture.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.320
One more detail, it's
straightforward to see that

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:14.120
there's no volume change.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.320
That is, if we take the
derivative of delta G of

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.210
mixing the partial derivative
with respect to pressure, at

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.840
constant temperature, of course,
there's no explicit

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.820
pressure dependence.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.870
This is zero.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:32.820
So again, in the ideal liquid
mixture case, their molecules

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.580
aren't interacting.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.460
So there's no reason, when I
open that barrier, that the

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:46.640
amount of volume they occupy
altogether is going to change.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:24:00.130
Any questions, so far?

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:01.110
OK.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:26.150
Then, let's move on to
non-ideal solutions.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.190
By the way, just to return
briefly to this topic of

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.050
osmotic pressure, I just want
to emphasize that result

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.950
didn't need any kind of energy
of mixing, either, right?

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.850
Just from the entropy
term you would burst

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.060
the cell or do whatever.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.710
You end up with a
larger pressure.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:55.300
So in other words, if you have
a situation where, here is A,

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.650
pure liquid.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:07.740
And here is A plus B liquid, so
mu A star is greater than

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:13.610
mu A. We know that in all cases
at the same pressure,

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.480
the chemical potential of the
mixture is lower than the

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.230
chemical potential of
the pure liquid.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:19.600
What's going to happen?

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:26.980
Well, A is going to, oh,
sorry, A over here is

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.240
going to rush in.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.970
It's going to get through
this, if I've got a

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.800
semi-permeable membrane, it's
permeable to A but not to B.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.240
Common situation, of course.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.440
That's certainly the case
for the cell membrane.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.080
Water may flow easily in through
the membrane, but all

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.590
of the stuff, all the salt and
everything else that's inside

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.320
the cell generally won't.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.400
So of course A then flows
through this, what's called a

00:25:52.400 --> 00:26:01.980
semi-permeable membrane.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:09.450
And you'll wind up with either a
burst membrane, or something

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.390
that looks like this.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:18.170
Where now there is additional
pressure here.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.270
And you'll have some different
mole fraction than you started

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:29.220
with before.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:54.650
Now let's go over to non-ideal
solutions.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.760
So let's just think
microscopically for a moment

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.720
about how this is
going to work.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.320
You know, normally, always,
there are interactions between

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.730
the molecules and the liquid.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.120
The liquid is a condensed
phase.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.520
The molecules are in immediate
proximity to each other.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.250
So it's very different from the
gas phase, where it can be

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.330
a pretty realistic approximation
to say, well,

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:19.750
the molecules are essentially
non-interacting.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.120
The ideal gas law may turn
out to be a very good

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.080
approximation.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.930
In the liquid, really, it's
never the case that you don't

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:28.650
have interactions.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:43.770
So if we just sketch that.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:50.890
If we start with a bunch of
molecules in A, they're

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.160
interacting.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.780
So there's some interaction
energy.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.630
I'll call it AA, it's the
interaction between two

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:09.630
molecules of A. In most cases
it'll be less than zero.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.350
That is, there'd be
a weak attraction.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:26.120
Same thing between
molecules of B.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.620
So that's my situation in
the separated liquids.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.020
I've got molecules in
each container.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:32.850
They're interacting.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:38.530
There's some energy associated
with that.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:50.490
So here's the pure separated
liquids.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.850
And now, I'll open up
the barrier and

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:54.820
let the liquids mix.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.430
And now suddenly, of course, A
and B are going to interact

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.320
with each other as well
as other molecules

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.470
of their own kind.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:11.040
So now, suddenly, there's going
to be some interaction

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.440
energy. uAB.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:36.240
And very simplistically, we can
envision that for some of

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.470
the molecules, essentially,
there would be

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.230
exchange of this sort.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.390
So, one neighbor of this
molecule and one neighbor of

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.640
this molecule will wind up
exchanged for some pairs of

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.440
molecules with the
unlike species.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.000
And essentially, likes
interactions will be replaced

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.780
by unlike interactions.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.680
So there's some now change
in energy involved.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.250
There's a delta u.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:15.590
And as outlined in this simple
picture, it's just 2 uAB minus

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.230
uAA plus uBB.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.910
Real liquids are very
complicated.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:31.140
For liquids with relatively
simple non-directional

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.000
interactions, things like
organic liquids that might

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.900
interact van der Waal's
interactions.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.630
This might be a reasonable
starting point.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:46.440
And in general, if we're going
to deal with relatively small

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:51.320
deviations from the ideal liquid
mixture, the ideal

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:56.250
solution, then we can start
with a model like this.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:31:00.800
And this difference is what's
going to determine how far the

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.950
liquid mixture will deviate from
the ideal solution case.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:08.380
Of course, we could always just
write a term like this.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:13.920
It may or may not be easily
expressed in this sort of way.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.020
So let's just think about what
the possibilities are.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.010
Of course, simply,
there are two.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:21.090
The sign could be positive
or negative.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:25.270
And what that means is, you
could have situations where

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.680
it's positive because basically
there's an energy of

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.310
mixing now in these cases.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:35.320
If that's not zero, unlike the
ideal case, now unlike before,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.560
where we just had entropy
driving the mixture, now

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.870
there's an energy of mixing.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:43.180
Could be positive or negative.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.260
If it's positive, that means
energetically speaking, the

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.210
mixture is unfavorable.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:54.080
In other words, the
intermolecular interactions

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.650
between like molecules are
more favorable then the

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.290
interactions between the unlike

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:11.350
molecules, in that case.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:25.430
So, delta u is greater
than zero.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:34.680
And our delta H of mixing
is going to be close

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.880
to delta u of mixing.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.640
That is, we're going to figure
that delta pV is not going to

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.070
be something large.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:52.020
And in that case, we can say
delta G of mixing is 1/4 n.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:57.180
And that's only because there
are 4 species involved here.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.380
Times delta u.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.120
In other words, I'm
multiplying this

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.360
molecular delta u.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.870
This is the change in
energy for this

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.050
collection of four molecules.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:11.760
Or of four molecular pairs.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.690
Plus the other stuff that we've
seen for the ideal case.

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:20.270
That is, the entropy term, of
course, is still there. xA log

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:29.500
xA plus xB log xB.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.820
And because we're treating the
case where this is positive,

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:47.730
that means this is bigger than
in the ideal solution case.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:50.270
So of course there are lots of
examples of each of these.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.570
In fact, this is the more
common deviation.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.630
So, and lots of examples.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.820
An easy one is acetone.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.960
And carbon disulfide.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:09.920
So, if we look at that, and
just see what the phase

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:38.940
diagram is going to look like,
it's the following.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.670
So let's start with
the ideal case.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:47.090
So I'm going to make B the
more volatile component.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.560
That is, B is going to be CS2.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:35:00.110
So here's p star CS2, which
I'll call p star B. And

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:11.470
somewhere down here will be p
star for A, that is, p star

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:15.400
for acetone.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.100
And this is going to be the
mole fraction of CS2.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:24.870
Or xB.

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:29.660
So let's start with
the ideal case.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.760
Not steep enough.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.680
Pretty good.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:45.630
OK.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.110
And now let's look at
what's going to

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.510
happen in the real mixture.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:54.140
Well, because we've got a
positive deviation, what's

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.790
going to happen is the mixing
is unfavorable.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.630
The molecules aren't
that happy any more

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.960
about being in solution.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.250
So what that means is,
relative to the ideal

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.520
solution, they'd rather go
up into the gas phase.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.610
They don't like being
in the mixture.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:16.900
Compared to what they would feel
in the ideal solution,

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.930
where there are no
interactions.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.310
Because the interactions between
unlike molecules are

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.850
unfavorable.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:27.540
So what's going to
happen, then, is

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:33.510
the pressure is higher.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.550
You have deviations from
the ideal case,

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.300
in the total pressure.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:53.790
And in each of the individual
partial pressures.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:58.400
That's the total pressure.
pA plus pB.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.000
In the ideal case it's
this straight line.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.340
In the non-ideal case, though,
it's bigger than

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.900
the straight line.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.120
Because more stuff wants to
get up into the gas phase.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.930
And it's the same for each
individual component.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:18.720
So here's pA.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.230
And there's pB.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:32.700
Any questions?

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.440
OK, so it's obvious just from
looking at this that each of

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.870
the partial pressures
is bigger than it is

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.300
in the ideal case.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.490
And so, so is the
total pressure.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:46.910
So in other words, if I say
what's the partial pressure of

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:50.520
CS2, well, since it's not the
simple ideal case, actually I

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.990
don't know what it
is in general.

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.260
It's not easy to calculate a
priori what it's going to do

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.940
all the way across the phase
diagram for any mole fraction.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.510
What I do know, though, is it's
bigger than it would be

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:03.950
for the ideal solution case.

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:11.530
In other words, it's bigger than
x CS2 times p star CS2,

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:15.580
the pressure over the
pure liquid CS2.

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:19.650
Same for acetone.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:29.280
It's bigger than x acetone
p star acetone.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.090
And since both partial pressures
are bigger, the

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.260
total pressure has
to be bigger.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.770
And of course, that's something
you can read right

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.420
off the diagram as well.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:49.390
In other words, the total
pressure is bigger than in the

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:55.710
ideal solution case.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:39:00.320
Any questions?

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.460
OK.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.115
So the negative case,
of course,

00:39:05.115 --> 00:39:07.390
is exactly the opposite.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:17.440
So I'll just go through
it quickly.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:23.240
So, remember positive deviations
came, let's put

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.090
this back up there.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.690
That came from the case where
the unlike intermolecular

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.180
interactions are not
as favorable.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.710
There's less attraction, more
repulsion than in this case.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.250
Of course, there are plenty of
cases of the opposite sort.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.270
Where the unlike intermolecular
interactions

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:45.290
are attractive.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:50.340
More than the interactions
between like molecules.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:54.570
And in that case, you have
the opposite result.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:40:05.620
So you can have negative
deviations.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:09.920
In other words, delta
u is less than zero.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.970
Lots of examples.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:13.500
I've got one in the notes,
it's just acetone and

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:14.920
chloroform.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:22.020
So if we get rid of the carbon
disulfide and put CHCl3 in

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.020
there, that's more favorable.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.030
Because there's weak
hydrogen bonding

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.140
between the unlike species.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.450
And not between the
like species.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:39.460
So what happens is, you have
acetone, it's this.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:47.500
And you have chloroform.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.340
And there's weak hydrogen
bonding between them.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.690
There's an attraction there.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:56.820
That doesn't exist
between either

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.610
case of the like molecules.

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:03.570
So now there's stronger
attraction between them than

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.870
there is between molecules
in either of

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.840
the pure liquid cases.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.240
So, of course, you know
that the opposite

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.600
result is going to happen.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:18.010
In this case, now you mix them
together, relative to the

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.555
ideal solution where there are
no interactions, now they want

00:41:21.555 --> 00:41:22.900
to be together.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:27.470
They're clinging to each other
through these hydrogen bonds.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:30.890
What's that mean for the
pressure up in the gas phase,

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.950
in the solution?

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:35.440
They don't want to go
there any more.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.880
Stuff in the gas phase now wants
to condense down into

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.340
the liquid.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.600
Because there they have
favorable interactions.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.650
So that's, of course,
what'll happen.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:50.280
And so then you just see the
opposite sort of deviation

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:56.120
from what I just illustrated
before.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:08.320
So then if we look at
p star CHCl3, where

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:13.820
are these lines going?

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.760
Well, may have been
more artistic.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:27.710
But I'm afraid I'm going to
have to go with reality.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:28.670
p star for acetone.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:35.330
There's chloroform.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:38.360
And now our deviation
is going to be in

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.610
the opposite direction.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.880
So all the, both of the partial
pressures and the

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:55.840
total pressure are going to go
lower than indicated here.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:03.180
So p total is now less than,
for the real case, is less

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:11.460
than p total for
the ideal case.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.090
In the situation where you have
attractive interactions

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:17.110
between the unlike molecules.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:20.860
Any questions?

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.650
OK.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:27.780
Now, in general, this
is complicated.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.190
To describe quantitatively
throughout the

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:33.100
entire phase diagram.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.430
The interactions are
complicated.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:38.480
Lots of times, molecules
interact with

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.750
more than one neighbor.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:45.770
So in general, we don't have a
simple analytical expression

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.950
for what the pressure is going
to do as a function of mole

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.230
fraction all the way
from zero to one.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.380
Of course, we have it
in very simple form

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.960
for the ideal solution.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.940
Because everything's linear.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.700
So it's very simple.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.510
These are replaced by equalities
and we know

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:04.060
everything.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.550
Now we don't.

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:08.520
But we can at least make some
progress by looking at the

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.080
limiting cases.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.730
Where you have just very
dilute solutions.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:17.160
So in that case, you
can anticipate

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.030
what's going to happen.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:24.730
So let's say we mix A and B.
And one of them is in very

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.740
dilute concentration.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:32.010
For the other one, for B, most
molecules of B are just going

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.200
to see themselves.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.980
They hardly know that
you've mixed any

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.840
molecules of A in there.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.570
For them, it's pretty much
an ideal solution.

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:44.090
They think they're in
an ideal solution.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:47.860
Which is to say there's an
entropy change in mixing.

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.400
But hardly any of them
experience interactions with

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.830
the unlike molecules.

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:58.850
For the dilute molecules,
there is a change.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:01.690
You can't use Raoult's
law any more.

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:06.470
But at least we can look of
the slope of the curve and

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.580
say, OK, at least in the dilute
solution case for a

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.620
little while it's going
to be linear.

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.930
We can understand it.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.950
We can tabulate it.

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:41.920
So let's look at
how that works.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.310
Alright.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:46.300
That limit is something that has
a name, that's called the

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.860
ideal dilute solution.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:50.810
Not to be confused with
the ideal solution.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.840
Where both constituents
follow Raoult's law,

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.490
as we've seen before.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:46:07.010
So ideal dilute solution.

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.440
We're going to just look
at these limits.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:17.360
So, if we start with the ideal
case, so let's imagine we're

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:22.510
going to look at carbon
disulfide again.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:32.860
Here's p star CS2, which
is our pB star.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.870
And this is x CS2, or xB.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:49.340
OK, well, what happens
if we've got

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.980
almost pure carbon disulfide.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.520
Well, what's going to happen is
in this limit, like I was

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:02.910
mentioning, up here the CS2
pretty much sees other CS2.

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:06.770
It thinks it's in an
ideal solution.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:11.130
It's going to look like that.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:15.920
Now, let's go to the
other limit.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:30.320
So this is the limit x CS2
equals xB approaches one.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.250
Raoult's law.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:38.070
Two, the other limit. x
CS2 approaches zero.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:39.920
We're down here.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.270
So it's definitely not
going to be the same.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:47.300
Because now, every molecule,
every CS2 molecule, is

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.890
completely surrounded
by acetone.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:54.250
So they all feel the
energy of mixing.

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:55.620
Because there are hardly
any of them there.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.520
So every one of them is, it's
very rare for one to find a

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.870
neighbor of its own kind.

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:03.820
And this is a case where there's
a positive deviation

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:04.550
from ideality.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:07.730
That is, the interactions
are less favorable

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.940
between unlike species.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.120
So, it's up here.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.990
Doesn't like that.

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:18.190
It says, get me out here, I'd
much rather be in the gas

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:22.970
phase, compared to the ideal
case, then surrounded by all

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:26.470
these acetone molecules,
right?

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.520
So that's what'll happen.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:35.050
And now it's up to the artist.

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:39.080
But in some way there's
going to be a set

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.610
of values in between.

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:44.910
And the ideal dilute solution by
itself isn't going to tell

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:45.850
us about that.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.970
It's telling us about
the two limits.

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:51.100
Now, if we follow this,
and I can see I'm

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.650
going to be in trouble.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:58.200
But I can do a little creative
bending of the line here.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.350
If I follow this slope
up to here,

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.660
it'll intercept somewhere.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.650
That has a name.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:07.620
It's called the Henry's
law constant.

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.020
I can write it as
K CS2, or KB.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:18.910
So the point is, that at
least for some range of

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:21.380
concentrations, the variation
is linear.

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:25.060
And what that means is, if
I know this Henry's law

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:32.160
constant, for CS2 mixed with
acetone specifically, it would

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:32.690
be different.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:34.050
If it's mixed with something
else, right?

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:36.750
Other kinds of interactions with
different energies will

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.700
have a different slope.

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.190
But if I know that number,
it's still useful.

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:47.260
Because at least for that pair
of constituents, I know the

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:52.450
dependents for some range
of concentrations.

00:49:52.450 --> 00:50:02.000
So this is Henry's
law. p CS --

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:15.720
Oops, CS2 is x CS2
times K CS2.

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:27.690
Not quite as convenient
as Raoult's law.

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.010
That number, I don't need
to know what the other

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:31.660
constituent is.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.010
It's just a property of CS2.

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:36.780
It depends on the temperature,
but not the other member of

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:37.510
the mixture.

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:42.300
This one does, but still there's
at least a substantial

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.890
number of these things
tabulated.

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:46.650
Especially for important
mixtures.

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:49.540
So it becomes useful for
dilute solutions.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.150
And there's an awful
lot of chemistry.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.330
There's an awful lot of biology
that happens in

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.190
relatively dilute solutions.

00:50:56.190 --> 00:51:02.390
OK.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.060
I'll leave it at this point.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.980
Next time we'll look at the
total phase diagram, just like

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:10.330
we did last time looking at
both the liquid and gas

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:13.450
coexistence curves, and seeing
what the behavior is as a

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:15.120
function of mole fractions.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.580
And we'll talk about
distillation and so forth in

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.840
non-ideal liquids.
