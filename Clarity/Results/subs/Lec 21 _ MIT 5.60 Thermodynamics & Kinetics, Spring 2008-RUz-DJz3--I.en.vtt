00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.250
PROFESSOR: So.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.180
In the meantime, you've started
looking at two phase

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.300
equilibrium.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.970
So now we're starting
to look at mixtures.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.560
And so now we have more
than one constituent.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.960
And we have more than
one phase present.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.930
Right?

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.750
So you've started to look at
things that look like this,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.800
where you've got, let's
say, two components.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:02.680
Both in the gas phase.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.580
And now to try to figure
out what the phase

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.870
equilibria look like.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.530
Of course it's now a little bit
more complicated than what

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.070
you went through before, where
you can get pressure

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.910
temperature phase diagrams with
just a single component.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.050
Now we want to worry about
what's the composition.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.620
Of each of the components.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.980
In each of the phases.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.110
And what's the temperature
and the pressure.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.930
Total and partial pressures
and all of that.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.430
So you can really figure out
everything about both phases.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.030
And there are all sorts of
important reasons to do that,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.820
obviously lots of chemistry
happens in liquid mixtures.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.900
Some in gas mixtures.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.010
Some where they're
in equilibrium.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.780
All sorts of chemical
processes.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.100
Distillation, for example,
takes advantage of the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.580
properties of liquid
and gas mixtures.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.400
Where one of them might be
richer, will be richer, and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.820
the more volatile of
the components.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.270
That can be used as a basis
for purification.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.120
You mix ethanol and water
together so you've got a

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.060
liquid with a certain
composition of each.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.750
The gas is going to be richer
and the more volatile of the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.400
two, the ethanol.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.420
So in a distillation, where you
put things up in the gas,

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.150
more of the ethanol comes up.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.190
You could then collect
that gas, right?

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.330
And re-condense it, and
make a new liquid.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.410
Which is much richer in ethanol
than the original

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.750
liquid was.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.410
Then you could make, then you
could put some of them up into

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.590
the gas phase.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.230
Where it will be still
richer in ethanol.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.250
And then you could collect that
and repeat the process.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.740
So the point is that properties
of liquid gas,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.920
two-component or multi-component
mixtures like

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.820
this can be exploited.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.180
Basically, the different
volatilities of the different

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.510
components can be exploited for
things like purification.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.100
Also if you want to calculate
chemical equilibria in the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.820
liquid and gas phase, of
course, now you've seen

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.100
chemical equilibrium, so the
amount of reaction depends on

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.910
the composition.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.990
So of course if you want
reactions to go, then this

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.110
also can be exploited by looking
at which phase might

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.460
be richer in one reactant
or another.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.220
And thereby pushing the
equilibrium toward one

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.120
direction or the other.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.950
OK.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.290
So. we've got some total
temperature and pressure.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:29.350
And we have compositions.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.020
So in the gas phase, we've got
mole fractions yA and yB.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:41.580
In the liquid phase we've got
mole fractions xA and xB.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.300
So that's our system.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.190
One of the things that you
established last time is that,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.010
so there are the total number
of variables including the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.070
temperature and the pressure.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.950
And let's say the mole fraction
of A in each of the

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.670
liquid and gas phases, right?

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.870
But then there are
constraints.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.660
Because the chemical
potentials have

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.330
to be equal, right?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.320
Chemical potential of
A has to be equal in

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.010
the liquid and gas.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.270
Same with B. Those two
constraints reduce the number

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.840
of independent variables.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.590
So there'll be two in this
case rather than four

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.750
independent variables.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.380
If you control those, then
everything else will follow.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.050
What that means is if you've got
a, if you control, if you

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.960
fix the temperature and the
total pressure, everything

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.650
else should be determinable.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.200
No more free variables.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.150
And then, what you saw is that
in simple or ideal liquid

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:57.800
mixtures, a result called
Raoult's law would hold.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.090
Which just says that the partial
pressure of A is equal

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:10.150
to the mole fraction of A in the
liquid times the pressure

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.830
of pure A over the liquid.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.140
And so what this gives
you is a diagram

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.080
that looks like this.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.490
If we plot this versus xB, this
is mole fraction of B in

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.540
the liquid going from
zero to one.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:39.050
Then we could construct a
diagram of this sort.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:46.440
So this is the total pressure
of A and B. The partial

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.490
pressures are given
by these lines.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.390
So this is our pA star
and pB star.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.060
The pressures over the pure
liquid A and B at the limits

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.830
of mole fraction of B
being zero and one.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.050
So in this situation, for
example, A is the more

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.640
volatile of the components.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.770
So it's partial pressure
over its pure liquid.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.580
At this temperature.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.280
Is higher than the partial
pressure of B

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.410
over its pure liquid.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.440
A would be the ethanol, for
example and B the water in

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.140
that mixture.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.320
OK.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.340
Then you started looking at both
the gas and the liquid

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.600
phase in the same diagram.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.520
So this is the mole fraction
of the liquid.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.810
If you look and see, well, OK
now we should be able to

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.310
determine the mole fraction
in the gas as well.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.520
Again, if we note total
temperature and pressure,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.900
everything else must follow.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:05.090
And so, you saw this
worked out.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:15.060
Relation between p and
yA, for example.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:23.940
The result was p is pA star
times pB star over pA star

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:31.250
plus pB star minus
pA star times yA.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.260
And the point here is that
unlike this case, where you

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.680
have a linear relationship, the
relationship between the

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.730
pressure and the liquid mole
fraction isn't linear.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.770
We can still plot
it, of course.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:51.240
So if we do that, then we end
up with a diagram that looks

00:07:51.240 --> 00:08:02.320
like the following.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:12.140
Now I'm going to keep both mole
fractions, xB and yB,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.830
I've got some total pressure.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:21.720
I still have my linear
relationship.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:30.610
And then I have a non-linear
relationship between the

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:36.260
pressure and the mole fraction
in the gas phase.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:49.180
So let's just fill this in.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:55.260
Here is pA star still.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.220
Here's pB star.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.060
Of course, at the limits they're
still, both mole

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:05.220
fractions they're zero and one.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.120
OK.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.290
I believe this is this is where
you ended up at the end

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.440
of the last lecture.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.740
But it's probably not so clear
exactly how you read

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.640
something like this.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.650
And use it.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.200
It's extremely useful.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.340
You just have to kind of learn
how to follow what happens in

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.500
a diagram like this.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.640
And that's what I want to spend
some of today doing.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.940
Is just, walking through what's
happening physically,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.960
with a container with a
mixture of the two.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.590
And how does that correspond
to what gets read off the

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.630
diagram under different
conditions.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.500
So.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:55.660
Let's just start somewhere on
a phase diagram like this.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:03.310
Let's start up here at some
point one, so we're in the

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.050
pure - well, not pure, you're
in the all liquid phase.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.120
It's still a mixture.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:20.000
It's not a pure substance.
pA star, pB star.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.430
There's the gas phase.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:33.460
So, if we start at one, and now

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.950
there's some total pressure.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.640
And now we're going
to reduce it.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.440
What happens?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.190
We start with a pure - with
an all-liquid mixture.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.790
No gas.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.890
And now we're going to bring
down the pressure.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:52.270
Allowing some of the liquid to
go up into the gas phase.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.130
So, we can do that.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:02.530
And once we reach point
two, then we find

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.290
a coexistence curve.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.190
Now the liquid and gas
are going to coexist.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.020
So this is the liquid phase.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:17.270
And that means that
this must be xB.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.490
And it's xB at one, but it's
also xB at two, and I want to

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.410
emphasize that.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:30.110
So let's put our pressure
for two.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:38.490
And if we go over here, this is
telling us about the mole

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.310
fraction in the gas phase.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.140
That's what these curves
are, remember.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.030
So this is the one that's
showing us the mole fraction

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.550
in the liquid phase.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.800
This nonlinear one
in the gas phase.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.050
So that means just reading off
it, this is xB, that's the

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.540
liquid mole fraction.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.220
Here's yB.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.750
The gas mole fraction.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.180
They're not the same, right,
because of course the

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.500
components have different
volatility.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.110
A's more volatile.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.360
So that means that the mole
fraction of B in the liquid

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.900
phase is higher than the
mole fraction of

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.460
B in the gas phase.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.370
Because A is the more
volatile component.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.990
So more, relatively more, of A,
the mole fraction of A is

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.730
going to be higher up
in the gas phase.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.230
Which means the mole
fraction of B is

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.840
lower in the gas phase.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:58.490
So, yB less than xB if
A is more volatile.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:04.140
OK, so now what's happening
physically?

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:09.910
Well, we started at a
point where we only

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.970
had the liquid present.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:23.790
So at our initial pressure,
we just have all liquid.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:29.800
There's some xB at one.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.060
That's all there is, there
isn't any gas yet.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.110
Now, what happened here?

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.200
Well, now we lowered
the pressure.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.710
So you could imagine, well,
we made the box bigger.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.800
Now, if the liquid was under
pressure, being squeezed by

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.530
the box, right then you
could make the box

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.270
a little bit bigger.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.880
And there's still no gas.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.540
That's moving down like this.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.220
But then you get to a point
where there's just barely any

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.660
pressure on top of the liquid.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.680
And then you keep expanding
the box.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.780
Now some gas is going to form.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.350
So now we're going to
go to our case two.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.740
We've got a bigger box.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.855
And now, right around
where this was, this

00:14:18.855 --> 00:14:22.610
is going to be liquid.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.850
And there's gas up here.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.330
So up here is yB at
pressure two.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:35.900
Here's xB at pressure two.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:40.590
Liquid and gas.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:49.110
So that's where we are
at point two here.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.760
Now, what happens if
we keep going?

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.560
Let's lower the pressure
some more.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.610
Well, we can lower
it and do this.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.020
But really if we want to see
what's happening in each of

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.490
the phases, we have to stay
on the coexistence curves.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.260
Those are what tell us what
the pressures are.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.520
What the partial pressure
are going to be

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.670
in each of the phases.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:18.240
In each of the two, in the
liquid and the gas phases.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.930
So let's say we lower the
pressure a little more.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.120
What's going to happen
is, then we'll end up

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.870
somewhere over here.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:32.270
In the liquid, and that'll
correspond to something over

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.220
here in the gas.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.980
So here's three.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:46.570
So now we're going to have,
that's going to be xB at

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.320
pressure three.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:16:01.800
And over here is going to
be yB at pressure three.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.840
And all we've done, of
course, is we've just

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.090
expanded this further.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:12.250
So now we've got a
still taller box.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.960
And the liquid is going to be a
little lower because some of

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:21.170
it has evaporated, formed
the gas phase.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.710
So here's xB at three.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:32.530
Here's yB at three, here's
our gas phase.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:38.740
Now we could decrease
even further.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.120
And this is the sort of
thing that you maybe

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.980
can't do in real life.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.590
But I can do on a blackboard.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.190
I'm going to give myself more
room on this curve, to finish

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:59.810
this illustration.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.810
There.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:02.990
Beautiful.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.030
So now we can lower a little bit
further, and what I want

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.450
to illustrate is, if we keep
going down, eventually we get

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:14.980
to a pressure where now if we
look over in the gas phase,

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.860
we're at the same pressure,
mole fraction that we had

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.340
originally in the
liquid phase.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:27.380
So let's make four even
lower pressure.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.990
What does that mean?

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:35.560
What it means is, we're
running out of liquid.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.770
So what's supposed to
happen is A is the

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.620
more volatile component.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:47.580
So as we start opening up some
room for gas to form, you get

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.430
more of A in the gas phase.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:56.390
But of course, and the liquid is
richer in B. But of course,

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.020
eventually you run
out of liquid.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:05.810
You make the box pretty big, and
you run out, or you have

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.670
the very last drop of liquid.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.150
So what's the mole fraction
of B in the gas phase?

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.640
It has to be the same as
what it started in

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.370
in the liquid phase.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.720
Because after all the total
number of moles of A and B

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.950
hasn't changed any.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.900
So if you take them all from the
liquid and put them all up

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.080
into the gas phase, it
must be the same.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.350
So yB of four.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:38.730
Once you just have
the last drop.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:45.250
So then yB of four is basically
equal to xB of one.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.110
Because everything's now
up in the gas phase.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:56.390
So in principle, there's still
a tiny, tiny bit of xB at

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.030
pressure four.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.500
Well, we could keep lowering
the pressure.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.850
We could make the box
a little bigger.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.240
Then the very last of the liquid
is going to be gone.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.180
And what'll happen then
is, we're all here.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.200
There's no more liquid.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.100
We're not going down on the
coexistence curve any more.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.660
We don't have a liquid gas
coexistence any more.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.640
We just have a gas phase.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.010
Of course, we can continue
to lower the pressure.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.580
And then what we're doing
is just going down here.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.370
So there's five.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:32.160
And five is the same as
this only bigger.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.560
And so forth.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.050
OK, any questions about
how this works?

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:45.650
It's really important to just
gain facility in reading these

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:51.320
things and seeing, OK, what is
it that this is telling you.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.730
And you can see it's not
complicated to do it, but it

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.880
takes a little bit of practice.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880
OK.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.550
Now, of course, we could do
exactly the same thing

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.670
starting from the gas phase.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.830
And raising the pressure.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.020
And although you may anticipate
that it's kind of

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.560
pedantic, I really do want to
illustrate something by it.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.960
So let me just imagine that
we're going to do that.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:34.550
Let's start all in
the gas phase.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:49.050
Up here's the liquid.
pA star, pB star.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:55.480
And now let's start
somewhere here.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.230
So we're down somewhere in
the gas phase with some

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.710
composition.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.030
So it's the same story, except
now we're starting here.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:02.680
It's all gas.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.780
And we're going to
start squeezing.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.780
We're increasing the pressure.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:14.530
And eventually here's one, will
reach two, so of course

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.580
here's our yB.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:23.590
We started with all
gas, no liquid.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.980
So this is yB of one.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.880
It's the same as yB of two, I'm
just raising the pressure

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.530
enough to just reach the
coexistence curve.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:40.810
And of course, out here tells
us xB of two, right?

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.180
So what is it saying?

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.730
We've squeezed and started
to form some liquid.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:50.650
And the liquid is richer in
component B. Maybe it's

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.590
ethanol water again.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.650
And we squeeze, and now we've
got more water in the liquid

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.280
phase than in the gas phase.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.100
Because water's the less
volatile component.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:04.100
It's what's going to
condense first.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.680
So the liquid is rich in the
less volatile of the

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.030
components.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.240
Now, obviously, we can continue
in doing exactly the

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.320
reverse of what I showed you.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.120
But all I want to really
illustrate is, this is a

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:24.200
strategy for purification of the
less volatile component.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.880
Once you've done this, well now
you've got some liquid.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.950
Now you could collect that
liquid in a separate vessel.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:46.160
So let's collect the liquid
mixture with xB of two.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.320
So it's got some mole fraction
of B. So we've purified that.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.860
But now we're going to start,
we've got pure liquid.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.880
Now let's make the vessel big.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.650
So it all goes into
the gas phase.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.150
Then lower p.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.460
All gas.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:12.990
So we start with yB of three,
which equals xB of two.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.290
In other words, it's the
same mole fraction.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:32.510
So let's reconstruct that.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.810
So here's p of two.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:41.470
And now we're going to go
to some new pressure.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:47.050
And the point is, now we're
going to start, since the mole

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.950
fraction in the gas phase that
we're starting from is the

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.550
same number as this was.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:54.460
So it's around here somewhere.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:24:01.490
That's yB of three
equals xB of two.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.050
And we're down here.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:08.620
In other words, all we've done
is make the container big

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.820
enough so the pressure's low and
it's all in the gas phase.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.180
That's all we have,
is the gas.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.590
But the composition is whatever
the composition is

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.500
that we extracted here
from the liquid.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.460
So this xB, which is the liquid
mole fraction, is now

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.290
yB, the gas mole fraction.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:27.900
Of course, the pressure
is different.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.950
Lower than it was before.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:31.990
Great.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.460
Now let's increase.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.880
So here's three.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.840
And now let's increase
the pressure to four.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.700
And of course what happens,
now we've got coexistence.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.630
So here's liquid.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.940
Here's gas.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:57.180
So, now we're over here again.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:02.870
There's xB at pressure four.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:10.850
Pure still in component B. We
can repeat the same procedure.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.060
Collect it.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.640
All liquid, put it
in a new vessel.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.000
Expand it, lower the pressure,
all goes back

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.400
into the gas phase.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.800
Do it all again.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.810
And the point is, what you're
doing is walking along here.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:25.830
Here to here.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.600
Then you start down here, and
go from here to here.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.020
From here to here.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.870
And you can purify.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:36.440
Now, of course, the optimal
procedure, you have to think a

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:36.860
little bit.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.890
Because if you really do
precisely what I said, you're

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.480
going to have a mighty little
bit of material

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.540
each time you do that.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.800
So yes it'll be the little bit
you've gotten at the end is

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.670
going to be really pure, but
there's not a whole lot of it.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.710
Because, remember, what we
said is let's raise the

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.340
pressure until we just
start being on

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.130
the coexistence curve.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.150
So we've still got mostly gas.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.430
Little bit of liquid.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.810
Now, I could raise the pressure
a bit higher.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.340
So that in the interest of
having more of the liquid,

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.400
when I do that, though, the
liquid that I have at this

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.060
higher pressure won't be as
enriched as it was down here.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.890
Now, I could still do
this procedure.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.560
I could just do more of them.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.060
So it takes a little bit of
judiciousness to figure out

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.660
how to optimize that.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.060
In the end, though, you can
continue to walk your way down

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.810
through these coexistence curves
and purify repeatedly

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:42.760
the component B, the less
volatile of them, and end up

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.920
with some amount of it.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.550
And there'll be some balance
between the amount that you

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.730
feel like you need to end
up with and how pure

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:54.470
you need it to be.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:58.280
Any questions about
how this works?

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:16.210
So purification of less
volatile components.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:20.290
Now, how much of each of
these quantities in

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.920
each of these phases?

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.490
So, pertinent to this
discussion, of course we need

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.860
to know that.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.010
If you want to try to optimize
a procedure like that, of

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.110
course it's going to be
crucial to be able to

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:35.650
understand and calculate for any
pressure that you decide

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:42.720
to raise to, just how many moles
do you have in each of

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.690
the phases?

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:47.290
So at the end of the day, you
can figure out, OK, now when I

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.620
reach a certain degree of
purification, here's how much

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.520
of the stuff I end up with.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.550
Well, that turns out
to be reasonably

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.570
straightforward to do.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:00.120
And so what I'll go through
is a simple mathematical

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.170
derivation.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.160
And it turns out that it allows
you to just read right

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.170
off the diagram how much of each
material you're going to

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:11.420
end up with.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.680
So, here's what happens.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:21.830
This is something called
the lever rule.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:39.880
How much of each component
is there in each phase?

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:52.630
So let's consider a
case like this.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:58.550
Let me draw yet once again,
just to get the numbering

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.260
consistent.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:07.220
With how we'll treat this.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.330
So we're going to start here.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.760
And I want to draw it right
in the middle, so I've

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.090
got plenty of room.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:26.550
And we're going to go
up to some pressure.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:29.360
And somewhere out there,
now I can go to

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.410
my coexistence curves.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.190
Liquid.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.630
And gas.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:40.460
And I can read off my values.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:44.280
So this is the liquid xB.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:52.060
So I'm going to go up to some
point two, here's xB of two.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:57.100
Here's yB of two.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.120
Great.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:10.310
Now let's get these
written in.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:17.060
So let's just define terms
a little bit. nA, nB.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:28.900
Or just our total number of
moles. ng and n liquid, of

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:38.040
course, total number of moles.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.990
In the gas and liquid phases.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.010
So let's just do the calculation
for each

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.820
of these two cases.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.670
We'll start with one.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:47.790
That's the easier case.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:51.040
Because then we have
only the gas.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:57.720
So at one, all gas.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.020
It says pure gas in the notes,
but of course that

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:00.850
isn't the pure gas.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:04.400
It's the mixture of the
two components.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.760
So.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.750
How many moles of A?

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.760
Well it's the mole fraction
of A in the gas.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:17.830
Times the total number
of moles in the gas.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.630
Let me put one in here.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:25.300
Just to be clear.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.350
And since we have all gas, the
number of moles in the gas is

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.290
just the total number
of moles.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:37.570
So this is just yA at
one times n total.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:38.610
Let's just write that in.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:43.220
And of course n total is
equal to nA plus nB.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:51.990
So now let's look at
condition two.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.820
Now we have to look a little
more carefully.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:32:03.790
Because we have a liquid
gas mixture.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:11.970
So nA is equal to yA
at pressure two.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:19.190
Times the number of moles
of gas at pressure two.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:23.322
Plus xA, at pressure two, times
the number of moles of

00:32:23.322 --> 00:32:38.240
liquid at pressure two.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.780
Now, of course, these things
have to be equal.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:45.230
The total number of moles of
A didn't change, right?

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:52.900
So those are equal.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:58.580
Then yA of two times
ng of two.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:08.770
Plus xA of two times n liquid of
two, that's equal to yA of

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:13.520
one times n total.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.460
Which is of course equal to yA
of one times n gas at two plus

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.350
n liquid at two.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:27.380
I suppose I could be,
add that equality.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.540
Of course, it's an
obvious one.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.030
But let me do it anyway.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.770
The total number of moles
is equal to nA plus nB.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:40.230
But it's also equal to
n liquid plus n gas.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:46.050
And that's all I'm taking
advantage of here.

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.680
And now I'm just going to
rearrange the terms.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:57.870
So I'm going to write yA at one
minus yA at two, times ng

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:02.120
at two, is equal to, and I'm
going to take the other terms,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:13.490
the xA term. xA of two
minus yA of one

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:18.050
times n liquid at two.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:21.570
So I've just rearranged
the terms.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:30.330
And I've done that because
now, I think I omitted

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:37.170
something here. yA
of one times ng.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:51.700
No, I forgot a bracket, is what
I did. yA of one there.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.910
And I did this because now I
want to do is look at the

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:57.040
ratio of liquid to gas
at pressure two.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:10.750
So, ratio of I'll put it gas
to liquid, that's ng of two

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:15.870
over n liquid at two.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:26.990
And that's just equal to xA of
two minus yA at one minus yA

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:37.070
at one minus yA at two.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.420
So what does it mean?

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:45.100
It's the ratio of these
lever arms.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.570
That's what it's telling me.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:51.380
I can look, so I raise the
pressure up to two.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.520
And so here's xB at two,
here's yB at two.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.960
And I'm here somewhere.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:08.640
And this little amount and this
little amount, that's

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.440
that difference.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.020
And it's just telling me that
ratio of those arms is the

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.900
ratio of the total number of
moles of gas to liquid.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.250
And that's great.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.000
Because now when I go back to
the problem that we were just

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.100
looking at, where I say, well
I'm going to purify the less

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.140
volatile component by raising
the pressure until I'm at

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.260
coexistence starting
in the gas phase.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.700
Raise the pressure, I've
got some liquid.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.030
But I also want some finite
amount of liquid.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.990
But I don't want to just, when
I get the very, very first

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.840
drop of liquid now collected, of
course it's enriched in the

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.910
less volatile component.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.970
But there may be a minuscule
amount, right?

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:47.710
So I'll raise the pressure
a bit more.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:48.890
I'll go up in pressure.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:53.900
And now, of course, when I do
that the amount of enrichment

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.710
of the liquid isn't as big as it
was if I just raised it up

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.110
enough to barely have
any liquid.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.650
Then I'd be out here.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:06.700
But I've got more material in
the liquid phase to collect.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.710
And that's what this allows
me to calculate.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:13.720
Is how much do I
get in the end.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.350
So it's very handy.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:22.420
You can also see, if I go all
the way to the limit where the

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:27.020
mole fraction in the liquid at
the end is equal to what it

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:32.170
was in the gas when I started,
what that says is that there's

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.960
no more gas left any more.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.490
In other words, these two
things are equal.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:44.580
If I go all the way to the point
where I've got all the,

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.630
this is the amount I started
with, in the pure gas phase,

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.920
now I keep raising
it all the way.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.950
Until I've got the same mole
fraction in the liquid.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:56.770
Of course, we know what
that really means.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:58.780
That means that I've gone
all the way from

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.310
pure gas to pure liquid.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:03.620
And the mole fraction in that
case has to be the same.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.110
And what this is just telling
us mathematically is, when

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.280
that happens this is zero.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:14.660
That means I don't have
any gas left.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.090
Yeah.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:26.390
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.980
PROFESSOR: No.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.580
Because, so it's the mole
fraction in the gas phase.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.960
But you've started with some
amount that it's only going to

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.690
go down from there.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.940
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:48.850
Yeah.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:53.310
Any other questions?

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:55.390
OK.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:39:01.980
Well, now what I want to do
is just put up a slightly

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.470
different kind of diagram, but
different in an important way.

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:09.830
Namely, instead of showing the
mole fractions as a function

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.640
of the pressure.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.680
And I haven't written it in,
but all of these are at

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.030
constant temperature, right?

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.820
I've assumed the temperature
is constant

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.480
in all these things.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.410
Now let's consider the other
possibility, the other simple

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:25.960
possibility, which is, let's
hold the pressure constant and

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.960
vary the temperature.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.270
Of course, you know in the lab,
that's usually what's

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.920
easiest to do.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.350
Now, unfortunately, the
arithmetic gets more

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:36.600
complicated.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:41.070
It's not monumentally
complicated, but here in this

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:45.820
case, where you have one linear
relationship, which is

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.630
very convenient.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.080
From Raoult's law.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.740
And then you have one non-linear
relationship there

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.970
for the mole fraction
of the gas.

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:59.180
In the case of temperature,
they're both,

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.960
neither one is linear.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.730
Nevertheless, we can just
sketch what the

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:04.850
diagram looks like.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.160
And of course it's very useful
to do that, and see how to

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.370
read off it.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.370
And I should say the derivation
of the curves isn't

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:14.530
particularly complicated.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.850
It's not particularly more
complicated than what I think

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.600
you saw last time
to derive this.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.600
There's no complicated
math involved.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.730
But the point is, the derivation
doesn't yield a

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.900
linear relationship for either
the gas or the liquid part of

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:54.730
the coexistence curve.

00:40:54.730 --> 00:41:03.140
OK, so we're going to look at
temperature and mole fraction

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.270
phase diagrams.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.460
Again, a little more complicated
mathematically but

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:20.160
more practical in real use.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:31.570
And this is T. And here is the,
sort of, form that these

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.130
things take.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.680
So again, neither
one is linear.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.430
Up here, now, of course if you
raise the temperatures, that's

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:41.120
where you end up with gas.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.310
If you lower the temperature,
you

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:48.790
condense and get the liquid.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:55.620
So, this is TA star.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:00.970
TB star.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:05.020
So now I want to stick
with A as the

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.590
more volatile component.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:11.030
At constant temperature, that
meant that pA star is bigger

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.200
than pB star.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.480
In other words, the vapor
pressure over pure liquid A is

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:23.150
higher than the vapor pressure
over pure liquid B. Similarly,

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.380
now I've got constant pressure
and really what I'm looking

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.990
at, let's say I'm at the
limit where I've

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:30.310
got the pure liquid.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:33.910
Or the pure A. And now I'm going
to, let's say, raise the

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:38.920
temperature until I'm at the
liquid-gas equilibrium.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.500
That's just the boiling point.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.820
So if A is the more volatile
component, it has the lower

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.800
boiling point.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.370
And that's what this reflects.

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:54.280
So higher pB star A corresponds
to lower TA star

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:59.230
A. Which is just the boiling
point of pure A.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:11.690
So, this is called
the bubble line.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:14.990
That's called the dew line.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:17.630
All that means is, let's say
I'm at high temperature.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.370
I've got all gas.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.090
Right no coexistence,
no liquid yet.

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:23.130
And I start to cool
things off.

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:25.820
Just to where I just barely
start to get liquid.

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.230
What you see that as is,
dew starts forming.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:30.570
A little bit of condensation.

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.765
If you're outside, it means on
the grass a little bit of dew

00:43:32.765 --> 00:43:34.440
is forming.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.300
Similarly, if I start at low
temperature, all liquid now I

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.660
start raising the temperature
until I just start to boil.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:46.180
I just start to see the
first bubbles forming.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:51.650
And so that's why these things
have those names.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:56.090
So now let's just follow along
what happens when I do the

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.780
same sort of thing that
I illustrated there.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:00.730
I want to start at one point
in this phase diagram.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:04.890
And then start changing
the conditions.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:17.610
So let's start here.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.330
So I'm going to start all
in the liquid phase.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:22.200
That is, the temperature
is low.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.970
Here's xB.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:27.690
And my original temperature.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:34.570
Now I'm going to raise it.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:39.590
So if I raise it a little bit,
I reach a point at which I

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.600
first start to boil.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:47.890
Start to find some gas
above the liquid.

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.880
And if I look right here,
that'll be my composition.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.430
Let me raise it a little
farther, now that we've

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:57.100
already seen the lever
rule and so forth.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.140
I'll raise it up to here.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:11.790
And that means that out here,
I suppose I should do here.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:18.730
So, here is the liquid mole
fraction at temperature two.

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:23.320
xB at temperature two.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.640
This is yB at temperature two.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:33.860
The gas mole fraction.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:37.840
So as you should expect, what's
going to happen here is

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:43.510
that the gas, this is going to
be lower in B. A, that means

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:45.570
that the mole fraction
of A must be

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.020
higher in the gas phase.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.700
That's one minus yB.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:46:05.340
So xA is one minus -- yA, which
is one minus yB higher

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:10.970
in gas phase.

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:16.370
Than xA, which is
one minus xB.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:20.480
In other words, the less
volatile component is enriched

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:39.100
up in the gas phase.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.320
Now, what does that mean?

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:46.890
That means I could follow the
same sort of procedure that I

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:50.710
indicated before when we looked
at the pressure mole

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:51.930
fraction phase diagram.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.970
Namely, I could do this
and now I could

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:57.150
take the gas phase.

00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:01.730
Which has less of B. It
has more of A. And

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:03.780
I can collect it.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.210
And then I can reduce
the temperature.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:06.310
So it liquefies.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:08.820
So I can condense it,
in other words.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.820
So now I'm going to start with,
let's say I lower the

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.710
temperature enough so I've got
basically pure liquid.

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:17.500
But its composition is the
same as the gas here.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.850
Because of course that's what
that liquid is formed from.

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:23.800
I collected the gas
and separated it.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.830
So now I could start
all over again.

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:31.240
Except instead of being here,
I'll be down here.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.060
And then I can raise the
temperature again.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.020
To some place where I choose.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.350
I could choose here, and
go all the way to hear.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:39.120
A great amount of enrichment.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.305
But I know from the lever rule
that if I do that, I'm going

00:47:41.305 --> 00:47:44.460
to have precious little
material over here.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.730
So I might prefer to raise the
temperature a little more.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:50.940
Still get a substantial
amount of enrichment.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.370
And now I've got, in the gas
phase, I'll further enriched

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.880
in component A. And again
I can collect the gas.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.850
Condense it.

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.280
Now I'm out here somewhere, I've
got all liquid and I'll

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.350
raise the temperature again.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.380
And I can again keep walking
my way over.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:11.640
And that's what happens during
an ordinary distillation.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:17.270
Each step of the distillation
walks along in the phase

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:23.530
diagram at some selected
point.

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.190
And of course what you're
doing is, you're always

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:27.520
condensing the gas.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.830
And starting with fresh liquid
that now is enriched in more

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:33.860
volatile of the components.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.680
So of course if you're really
purifying, say, ethanol from

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.710
an ethanol water mixture,
that's how you do it.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:41.640
Ethanol is the more volatile
component.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.870
So a still is set up.

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.080
It will boil the stuff and
collect the gas and and

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:45.920
condense it.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.350
And boil it again,
and so forth.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:50.600
And the whole thing can be set
up in a very efficient way.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.420
So you have essentially
continuous distillation.

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.970
Where you have a whole sequence
of collection and

00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:00.610
condensation and reheating
and so forth events.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:03.930
So then, in a practical way,
it's possible to walk quite

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:10.870
far along the distillation,
the coexistence curve, and

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:16.630
distill to really a high
degree of purification.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:22.270
Any questions about
how that works?

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:24.240
OK.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.720
I'll leave till next time the
discussion of the chemical

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.190
potentials.

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:33.980
But what we'll do, just to
foreshadow a little bit, what

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:36.330
I'll do at the beginning of the
next lecture is what's at

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:37.280
the end of your notes here.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.710
Which is just to say OK, now
if we look at Raoult's law,

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:44.470
it's straightforward to say what
is the chemical potential

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:47.290
for each of the substances in
the liquid and the gas phase.

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:50.100
Of course, it has to be equal.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:53.450
Given that, that's for
an ideal solution.

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:55.490
We can gain some insight
from that.

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:57.930
And then look at real
solutions, non-ideal

00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:00.860
solutions, and understand a lot
of their behavior as well.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.160
Just from starting from our
understanding of what the

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.420
chemical potential does even
in a simple ideal mixture.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.150
So we'll look at the chemical
potentials.

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:10.740
And then we'll look at
non-ideal solution

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.310
mixtures next time.

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:13.770
See you then.
