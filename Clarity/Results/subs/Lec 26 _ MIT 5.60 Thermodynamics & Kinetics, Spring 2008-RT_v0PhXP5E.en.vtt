00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.670
PROFESSOR: So you've
been learning

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.985
about statistical mechanics.

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:29.930
The microscopic underpinnings
of thermodynamics.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:40.560
And last time we ended up
working with the canonical

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.530
partition function and showing
that once you have the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.490
canonical position function,
you have basically every

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.210
thermodynamic quantity that
you've learned how to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.280
calculate this far
in the course.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.590
But before I start, on the
lecture notes 25, there were a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.570
couple typos in there that
actually didn't make any

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.870
difference to the final
result because they

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.310
cancel each other out.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.460
But it's been corrected
on the web version.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.590
And near the bottom of the page
-- because we're going to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.060
be mostly using these
notes today.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.570
Near the bottom of the page,
where it says A is equal to u

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.240
minus TS is equal to u.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.040
That should be a plus
here. dA/dT, volume.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.650
And then further down
the next line, blah

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.600
blah blah blah blah.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.500
Minus u over T squared.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.680
And this should be
a minus here.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.110
One over T. dA/dT,
V. And et cetera.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.010
So luckily these two typos
cancel each other out the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.940
result is correct.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.150
But there it is.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.180
OK.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.980
So last time, then, you saw
how from the canonical

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.230
partition function, you could
get something like the energy.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.710
You wrote down an equation.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:16.460
The energy is equal to k,
T squared, d log Q / dT.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.180
Under constant volume.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.100
And number of particles.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.260
And then you notice that the
important variables are the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.820
volume, the number of
particles, and the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.540
temperature.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.920
And we know that every
thermodynamic quantity has a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.900
set of natural variables.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.230
For the Gibbs free energy it
was the pressure and the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.070
temperature, the number
of particles.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.510
And for the volume of the number
of particles and the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.830
temperature, we know that that's
the Helmholtz energy.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.795
So the natural variable that
we would associate -- the

00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:06.130
natural thermodynamic variable
we would associate with that

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.510
set of constraints is the
Helmholtz free energy.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.000
So it becomes interesting, then,
to figure out, how can

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.320
we write the Helmholtz free
energy in terms of the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.660
canonical partition function?

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.340
They seem to have the same
set of natural variables.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.930
And that's what you started
doing and what we'll do today.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.280
And that's where the
typo comes in.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.046
So let's write what we know
about the Helmholtz free

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:40.600
energy in terms of
the energy u.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.180
I already wrote it up
there. u minus TS.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.860
That's the definition of the
Helmholtz free energy.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:54.100
And from the fact that dA is
equal to minus p dV, minus S

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.170
dT, plus mu dN.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.153
We can read out what S, here,
is in terms of the Helmholtz

00:04:04.153 --> 00:04:05.100
free energy.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:13.430
S is just dA/dT, constant V and
N. So we can plug that in

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.160
here. u minus T dA, with a
minus sign there, so that

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.000
becomes a plus.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.730
And hence the typo. dT,
constant V, and N. OK.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.820
So now we have an equation
that relates u and the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.420
partition function.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.240
We want an equation
that relates A and

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.580
the partition function.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.780
If we rearrange this slightly,
we can get that u, then, is

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:53.520
equal to A minus T, dA/dT,
constant V and N. So the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.830
question that we could ask
ourselves is -- is there a

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.320
function of A that kind
of looks like that?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.280
And I know the answer, so I'm
going to give it to you.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.800
A function of A that looks
like the sum of A minus

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.640
something times the derivative,
with respect to

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.550
that something.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.490
We should try to look at
something like the derivative

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.200
d(A/T)/dT, constant V and
N. So if you take that

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:35.780
derivative, you end up with
one over T, dA/dT, minus A

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.040
over T squared.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.550
But if you look at this result,
here, and you multiply

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.000
by T squared, there's the A, and
there's the T times dA/dT.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.910
There's the A that -- we just
have the sign wrong.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.700
So we have -- multiply this
by minus T squared.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.510
Minus T squared, times
minus T squared.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.560
And you have the same
thing as here.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:14.210
So that tells us then, that u
can be written as minus T

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:22.420
squared, d(A/T)/dT,
constant volume.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.260
It's a nice way to relate
those two energies.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.230
And we have an expression
for u in terms of

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.900
the canonical function.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:41.390
And we can then replace
it in here.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:52.000
And that gets us, then, that
minus T squared, d(A/T)/dT,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.410
constant number and volume
is equal to u.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:02.630
And u, we saw, was equal to
k T squared d log Q / dT.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.830
V and N fixed.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.130
And then we can start --

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.050
The t squareds disappear here.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.070
And then we have d/dT on
this side and d/dT.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.370
Let's just take the integral.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.760
You take the integral of both
sides, and that gets us that

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:40.420
then A over T is equal to k,
log Q, plus the constant of

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.580
integration.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.260
And we can take that constant
of integration to

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.380
be whatever we want.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.810
Energy is all relative to
some reference point.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.600
We can take it to be zero.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:59.500
A is equal to k T log Q.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.230
That's a pretty neat result.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.850
There's the microscopic
underpinning of things.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.480
Where we know about atoms, and
energies, and states, and even

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.610
quantum mechanics,
and all sorts of

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.600
things goes into here.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.460
All the microscopic information
goes in here.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.290
And there's a thermodynamic
variable that only cares about

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.870
the macroscopic state
of matter.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.060
It doesn't care that there
are atoms there.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.670
It just cares that you know the
pressure, the volume, the

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.970
temperature, or any
couple variables.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.270
And you can get a direct
equality without any

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.990
derivatives or anything.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.480
Between the macroscopic
and the microscopic.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:41.390
So this is really pretty
remarkable.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.970
And once you have A, you
have everything.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.710
Just like before, we said once
you have G, that Gibbs free

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.610
energy, when we were talking
about things that depend on

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.800
pressure and temperature.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.460
You have everything.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.390
It's the same thing here.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.960
We've got A, we've got u.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.320
We have everything.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.400
We can calculate every
single thermodynamic

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.080
variable from then on.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.900
For instance, if we want to have
the entropy, S is equal

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:08.190
to minus A over T, minus u over
T. Where did I get that?

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.480
I got that from way up here.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.920
A is equal to u minus TS.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.400
I solved for S in terms
of A and u.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.290
I've got expressions in
terms of the canonical

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.960
function for A and u.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.600
Plug that in there.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:32.860
Get k log Q, plus k T, d log
Q / dT, constant number and

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.180
volume. et cetera.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.310
You can get the pressure.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:41.780
You can get the pressure from
the fact that the pressure up

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.890
here is a derivative of A
with respect to volume.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.150
So you take the derivative of A
with respect to volume here.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.960
You get the pressure.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.430
If you want the chemical
potential.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.300
The chemical potential from the
fundamental equation up

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.610
here is the derivative
of A with respect to

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.320
the number of particles.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.790
You take the derivative of A
with respect to the number of

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.920
particles, you get the chemical
potential in terms of

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.780
the canonical partition
function.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.840
So you've got everything.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.370
You've got u.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.590
You've got A. You've got p.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.620
You've got S. You've got H.
You've got G. Name your

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.530
valuable, you've got it.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.890
You want the heat capacity?

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.820
It can get you the heat capacity
in terms of the

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.600
partition function.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.550
Any questions?

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.150
Alright so let's go on.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.050
Let's look a little bit closer
at the entropy, in terms of

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:46.650
the microscopic theory here.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:53.370
So let's start with S is A minus
u over T. And let's see

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.270
how far we can go.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.160
Alright.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.660
Let's write it in terms of --
let's write A and u in terms

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.230
of things that we know.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.070
And let me just go to the end
to tell you where I'm going,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.950
and why I'm going
to make certain

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.010
changes in my math here.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.920
So what we're going to get at
the end is that S is this very

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:23.730
nice quantity, which is
minus k, pi log pi.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.050
Where the p's are the microstate
probabilities.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.270
The probability that your state
is in a particular --

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:30.640
yes?

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.640
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:41.100
PROFESSOR: S is u minus A. Yes.
u minus A. Thank you.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:48.000
I should read my notes.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.550
OK.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.000
So we're going to equate
S here in terms of the

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.760
probabilities of microstates.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.095
And that's going to be --
remember how we talked about S

00:11:58.095 --> 00:12:03.580
is related to concepts
of randomness,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.440
or order, or disorder.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.550
So the number of possible
microstates is related to the

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.740
number of amount of disorder
that you might have.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.370
If you have a pure crystal,
and every atom is in its

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.290
place, then the number of
microstates at zero degree

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.130
Kelvin is one.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.600
So the probability of being
in that microstate is one.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.040
And the probability of
being in every other

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.270
microstate is zero.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.855
Alright, so there's a
relationship that we're going

00:12:29.855 --> 00:12:31.780
to have here, which is going
to be interesting.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.710
Let's derive it.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:38.230
That means that we're going to
want to have this somehow pop

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.960
out of the equation.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.760
We're going to want to have this
pop out of the equation.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:59.350
If you remember, pi is the --
pi is e to the minus the Ei

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:08.640
over kT, divided by the
partition function Q. So

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.150
somehow we are going to have
to get this to come out.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.660
We're going to have to have
these e to the minus Ei over

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.250
kT's come out.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:15.450
OK.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.860
So let's try to get them
to come out right away.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.770
We know u.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.880
A way to write u is the
average energy.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:29.760
Which means let's take
one over kT out here.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.300
And there's a -- let's
divided by k here.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.970
Let's get the k here. kT here.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.610
We're going to want to have
a k come out here.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.700
There's the k here.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.950
So that's one way of getting
it to come out.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:49.770
And then the u is going to be
the average energy. e to the

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.330
minus Ei, minus kT.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.760
That's just writing the
average energy.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.800
So the energy times the
probability of having that

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.000
energy divided by the
normalization.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.880
Plus, well, A is just log Q.
A over kT is just log Q. So

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.670
we've managed to extract
this guy out here.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.530
OK.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.880
Now, this sum, here,
this is sum over i.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.850
I'd really like to have this
sum come all the way out.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.930
So I've got to find
a way to do that.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:36.430
And it would be nice if I
could find a sum here.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.930
Maybe if I multiply by one.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.470
If I write one in a funny way.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.430
Get a log here.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.900
You know, if I've got a couple
logs here, maybe I can combine

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.740
them to get a ratio.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.920
So let's rewrite this Ei
in a funny way, here.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.562
Ei is --

00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:57.710
I'm just rewriting it,
but in a strange way.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:03.490
Log e to the minus Ei over kT.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.110
So if I take the log of e to
the minus the Ei over kT.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.220
I get minus Ei over kT.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.800
The kT's disappear.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.820
So I just get Ei
is equal to Ei.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:16.830
I'm just writing something
that's pretty obvious here.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.950
And then we're going to
take that expression,

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.090
and put it in here.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:29.270
So now I'm going to be able to
write S over k is minus --

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.580
So the kT here cancels
out this kT here.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:42.890
Sum over i. e to the
minus Ei over kT.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.810
Over Q. That's that
term right here.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:50.210
And then I have the Ei,
which is log e to the

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.600
minus Ei over kT.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.990
This whole thing is in this
parenthesis here.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.210
And then I have the plus log

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:17.770
Q. Plus log Q. OK.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.460
So I have this nice thing here.
e to the minus Ei over

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.770
kT divided by Q. Well that's
looking an awful lot

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.390
like this pi here.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.280
Which is what I'm trying
to get out.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.200
I'm trying to get these
pi's coming out.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.320
So that's a nice thing
to have here.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.110
Now if I could only have a pi
coming out here, somehow, that

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.330
would be great too.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.816
And if I also got a sum here,
that's a sum over i I could

00:16:39.816 --> 00:16:41.490
sort of combine everything
together.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:45.640
So I'm going to write
one in a funny way.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.890
One is equal to the sum
of all probabilities.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.100
That's obvious.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.790
And I'm going to write this
pi here in a form

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.880
that looks like this.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:05.300
Sum over all i, e to the minus
Ei over kT, divided by Q. Just

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.830
writing one.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.870
The sum of all probability
is equal to one.

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:14.220
And I'm going to take this one,
here, and I'm going to

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.180
put it right in here.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.940
Now log Q doesn't care on i,
so it's just a number.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.120
So that allows me
to rewrite --

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:32.170
S over k is minus the sum over
i. e to the minus Ei over kT,

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.470
divided by the partition
function.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:41.930
Times the log of e to the
minus Ei over kT.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:56.190
Plus sum over i, e to the minus
Ei over kT over Q. Times

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.430
log

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.920
Q. OK good.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.830
I'm going to take these
summations.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.340
Now everything is over
the sum of Ei.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:03.840
This is great.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.000
And there's this factor here.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.705
E to the minus Ei over
kT divided by

00:18:07.705 --> 00:18:08.500
the partition function.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.364
That appears in both.

00:18:09.364 --> 00:18:12.740
I can factor that out. and.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.360
Then I have these two logs.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.390
Log of this and log of that.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.800
That I can also combine
together.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.140
This is the log of this.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.260
And then there's a minus sign.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.860
So if I take the -- it's going
to be the log of this minus

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.610
the log of that,.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:35.190
It's going to end
up with a ratio.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:41.430
S over k is equal to minus Ei.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:48.280
Taking the summation out. e to
the minus Ei over kT, over Q.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.710
That's this term.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.440
That term.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.210
And then I have the logs.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.740
Log of e to the minus
Ei over kT.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.520
This is a minus sign.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.430
This is a plus sign.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:08.170
That means I divide here
by Q. This is great.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:08.740
Look.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.520
This e to the minus Ei over kT
over Q. e to the minus Ei over

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.690
kT over Q. What is that?

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:19.320
That's just pi.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.710
This is pi.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:25.900
That's the probability
of microstate i.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:40.390
And this is equal to minus
sum over i, pi log pi.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.800
There's the k, here.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:55.460
S is equal to minus k, log
sum over i, pi, log pi.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.820
Another great result.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.110
Now if you system is isolated.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.840
If you have an isolated
system, that means

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.610
that the energy --

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.170
You've got your boundary.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.080
The boundary doesn't let
energy go in and out.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.350
Doesn't let the number of
particles go in and out.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.120
Every single microstate is going
to have the same energy.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.010
If this system is isolated.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.000
The only thing you're going
to change is the

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.720
positions of the particles.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.390
Or their vibrational energy.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.940
Or something.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.550
But let's just stick
with translation.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.690
You're just going to change
the positions.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.950
You're not going to
change the energy.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:42.530
So, if the system is isolated,
then the degeneracy of your

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.260
energy is just a number of ways
that you can flip the

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.840
positions around.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.960
Indistinguishable ways.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.580
So the probability is just one
over the number of possible

00:20:54.580 --> 00:21:00.060
ways of switching positions
around for your particles.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:30.650
So for an isolated system,
all microstates

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:35.830
have the same energy.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.580
We can set that equal to zero
as our reference point.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.090
And the probability of being in
any one microstate is just

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.600
one over the number
of possible ways

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.050
of rearranging things.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:53.420
So the probability of been in
any one microstate is one over

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.220
the number of my microstates.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:01.030
They all have the same energy.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:07.470
Where this is the degeneracy.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:14.760
So now when you plug that
in here, S is minus k.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:23.460
Sum over all microstates from
one to blah, one over blah,

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.530
log of blah.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.510
This is a number.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.930
It can come out.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.260
The sum of one to omega.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.070
Of one over omega.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.040
Is omega times omega.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.930
It's one.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.520
The one over omega -- the log of
one over omega is minus the

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.070
log of omega.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:53.410
The negative signs cancel out.
k log capital omega.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:23:04.930
For an isolated system.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.280
You've seen this before,
probably.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.660
This is called the Boltzmann
equation.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.940
And that is what is
on his tombstone.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.960
If you go to - I think it's
in Germany somewhere.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.520
Is it in Germany?

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.560
Do you guys know?

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.070
STUDENT: Austria.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.270
PROFESSOR: Austria, thank you.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.910
I knew it was that part
of the world.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.520
If you go to Austria, to some
famous cemetery, and go look

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.990
for the tombstone that says
S is equal to log omega.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:33.890
That's where Boltzmann
is buried.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:34.730
OK.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.040
So this picture of
-- yes question?

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:44.000
STUDENT: Can you repeat the
argument for making that one

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.060
over omega go away?

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.850
PROFESSOR: Making the one
over omega go away here?

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.660
Because you're taking the sum
of all states from one, i

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.550
equals one to omega.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.690
So it's one over our omega plus
one over omega plus one

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.510
over omega plus --
omega times.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.840
And this is just a number.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.980
So it comes out.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.750
It's not in the sum.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:13.310
So the sum, here, is
all by itself.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:21.520
Any other questions?

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:21.750
OK.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:30.140
That's why we talk about
entropy as being this

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.700
fundamental property that tells
you about the number of

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.910
available states.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:36.790
That's what it is.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.250
You've got this connection now
between this variable, which

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.400
is sort of hard to really
intuitively understand, when

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.480
you're talking about
thermodynamics.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.690
And this is much easier to
understand here, in terms of

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:52.430
the available ways of
distributing your energy, or

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.430
your particles, in
this case here.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:59.910
In different bins.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:06.450
OK any questions?

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:13.850
So the next topic is we're going
to work a little bit

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.720
with the partition functions.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:21.190
And see how when you have
systems that have multiple

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:25.610
degrees of freedom, where each
degree of freedom has a

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.380
different kind of energy.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.200
Let's say translation,
rotation, vibration.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.860
Then you can have a partition
function for each of these

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.630
degrees of freedom.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.570
And whereas the energies of the
degrees of freedom add up,

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.960
the partition functions
get multiplied.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.950
So it's the separation of the
partition functions into

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:50.610
subsystem partition functions.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.960
So so far, we've written for

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.760
translation partition function.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:05.250
That the system partition
function is the molecular

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:09.970
partition function
to the Nth power.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.880
If you have distinguishable
particles.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.610
And you have to divide
by N factorial.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.670
If you can swap particles
without knowing the

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:22.270
difference.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.550
This is the number of ways of
swapping N particles with each

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:40.340
other, so it's indistinguishable
particles.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:40.660
OK.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:46.730
So now let's say that --

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:51.930
Let's just make sure that --

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.770
Let's say that your energy
of your system -- yes?

00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:09.630
STUDENT: It says that when
system's not isolated,

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.900
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:10.420
PROFESSOR: Where does
it say that?

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.240
In the notes?

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:19.320
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.880
PROFESSOR: Let me see
the notes here.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:45.140
What does it say?

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.510
So that sentence has to
do with this guy here.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.840
Basically it says that if
you've got a huge number

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.600
particles, the average energy
is a given number.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.070
And the fluctuations around that
average are very small.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:07.680
And so, the system behaves
as if it's isolated.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.010
So when you have a system which
is not isolated, then

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.530
energy can come in and
out of the system.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:15.370
So in principle, over time,
you could have huge energy

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:16.040
fluctuations.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.550
As energy comes out,
or energy comes in.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:23.000
And if you have a countable
number of molecules in your

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.830
system, then if one molecule
suddenly captures a lot of

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.430
energy, then the whole system
energy will go up a lot.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:34.620
But if you have ten to the
24th molecules, if one

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.680
molecule suddenly gains a lot
of energy, the system energy

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.030
doesn't care.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.090
So small fluctuations -- or big
fluctuations in the small

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.890
number of molecules doesn't
make any difference to the

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.110
total energy.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.580
And so you can still
use this then.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.430
It's good enough.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:57.440
STUDENT: So how long is that
good enough [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.340
PROFESSOR: Well if it's
accountable, a handful of

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.280
things, and it's not valid.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.260
If it's ten to the 24th and it's
valid, and somewhere in

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.200
between it breaks down.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.950
Then I don't know what
the answer is.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.570
But usually if you have a
thermodynamic system, then

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.120
it's big enough.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.900
That's what thermodynamics
is about.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.740
Where you don't really care
that you have atoms there.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.540
You don't even know you
have atoms there.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:23.090
So it's big enough.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.530
Good question.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:31.900
Alright, so now let's take our
microstate energy here.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.870
And our microstate energy is the
sum of all the molecular

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.470
energies Ei.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:56.870
So it's the sum of all
energies E sub,

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.190
over all the atoms.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:02.580
And each one of these energies,
if it's a molecular

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:08.460
energies, can be indexed by a
quantum number of some sort.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.760
So it would be the sum
over all energies.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.760
So quantum number for particle
one, n1 is some sort of

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.660
quantum number. n2 is some sort
of quantum number. n3 is

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.190
some sort of quantum number.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.460
And then you have all
the molecules.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:31.200
En1 plus En2 plus
En3, et cetera.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.250
So this is the energy from
molecule one, energy from

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.430
molecule two, energy from
molecule three, energy from

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:37.390
molecule four.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.230
And that little n tells you
which energy state that

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.260
molecule is.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:47.050
And the sum of all
these energies is

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.310
your microstate energy.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.890
As long as you can write this
this way, then you're allowed

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:57.220
to write this this way.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.840
So that basically means that
they're not interacting with

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.700
each other.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.630
They're independent
from each other.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:03.900
In this case here.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:09.900
So now if I write Q in terms
of the sum over all

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:16.550
microstates Ei. e to the
minus Ei over kT.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:20.290
I'm going to replace this Ei
here with the sum over all

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.010
these energies here.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:24.830
And so the sum over all
microstates, then, becomes the

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.210
sum over all possible
combinations of quantum

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:37.090
numbers. n1, n2, n3,
n4, et cetera.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:40.180
All the possible
ways of getting

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.830
molecule one in some state.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:44.330
All the possible ways of getting
molecule two in some

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:45.850
quantum number state.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:51.050
And then e to the minus -- and
instead of capital Ei, I'm

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:54.080
going to write the molecular
energies.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:00.040
En1, plus En2, plus epsilon
n3 plus et cetera.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:06.200
And then divide by kT.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:10.270
Basically I'm going to prove
that this is a fine statement

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:17.260
to make, as long as you can
write the energy as a sum of

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:26.380
component energies.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.840
OK so now this term here, e to
the minus En1, only cares

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.340
about this sum here.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.590
En2, that's molecule number
two, only cares

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.130
about this sum here.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.320
Molecule number three only cares
about the sum over all

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.790
possible quantum numbers
connected to

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.000
molecule number three.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.970
So I can factor out all these
sums into a factor of sums.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:51.220
Is equal to the sum over quantum
number n1. e to the

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:58.780
minus epsilon of n1,
divided by kT.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:10.104
Times n2 e to the minus epsilon
n2 over kT, times n3 e

00:33:10.104 --> 00:33:13.200
to the minus epsilon n3 divided
by kT, et cetera.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.750
And now each one of these is
basically the molecular

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:16.500
partition function.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.180
These are all the possible
energies of that molecule.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.340
And the sum over all possible
energies times e to the minus

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.860
E over kT is the partition
function for the molecule.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:31.190
So we have q for molecule one
times q for molecule two.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:32.900
And they're all the same.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.630
There are N of them.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:42.190
Plus q to the N. So just, in a
way, clarified that the reason

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:46.170
why we're able to write this
system partition function, in

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:50.840
terms of the molecular partition
functions, with N of

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.410
them, to the Nth power, is
because we were able to

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.320
separate out the energy here.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.550
In terms of the independent
molecular energies.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.280
Where this is saying the
molecules don't interact with

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.570
each other.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.410
And are independent
from each other.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:07.700
And then the one over N
factorial comes in, so that

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:12.930
you don't over count, for
translation, the positions.

00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:21.360
They're indistinguishable.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.070
OK.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:23.320
So now we can have --

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.100
Actually we're not --

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:30.560
This basic concept of the
partition function multiplying

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:36.310
each other, if the energies add,
is not limited to going

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.710
from the molecular partition
functions to the system

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.440
partition function.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.250
You can also look
at the molecular

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.090
partition function itself.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:49.120
And if the energy, the molecular
energy, can be

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.770
written in terms of a sum of
energies of different degrees

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.744
of freedom, for instance, the
energy of a molecule could be

00:34:56.744 --> 00:34:58.560
the energy of the vibration,
plus the energy of the

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.685
translation, plus the energy
of the rotation, plus the

00:35:01.685 --> 00:35:03.596
energy of the magnetic field,
plus the energy of the

00:35:03.596 --> 00:35:04.410
electric field. et cetera.

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.520
You have many energies that can
add up with each other to

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.640
create the molecular energy.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.320
And what we're going to be able
to write, then, is that

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.270
this molecular partition
function itself can be written

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:22.310
in terms of a product of
partition functions for the

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.680
sub parts of the molecular
energy.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:40.520
So let me clarify
that statement.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:46.350
So if I can write my molecular
energy, epsilon, is equal to a

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:51.790
translational energy, plus a
vibrational energy, plus a

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:55.090
rotational energy, plus every
other little energies that you

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:58.730
can think of that are
independent of each other.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:03.640
Then using the same argument we
used to show that Q is the

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:07.550
multiplication of these
molecular partition function,

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:11.300
we can write that the molecular
partition function,

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:18.120
little q, is just the
multiplication of the degree

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.410
of freedom partition
functions --

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.490
molecular partition functions.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.810
The translational partition
function times the vibrational

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:28.200
partition function, times
the rotational partition

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.670
function, et cetera.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:32.910
If the energies add, then the
partition functions multiply

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:36.190
each other.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.830
And that's going to be powerful
because when we look

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:43.220
at something like a polymer or
DNA or protein or something,

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.490
in solution.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.710
And we're going to be looking at
the configurations possible

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:52.970
for that polymer or that
biopolymer, then we'll know

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:56.938
that the energy of that polymer
in solution is going

00:36:56.938 --> 00:37:00.010
to be -- we'll be able to
approximate it as the energy

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:03.653
of the configuration
for that polymer.

00:37:03.653 --> 00:37:06.030
The different ways that
you can fold the

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.210
protein, for instance.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.050
Plus everything else.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:14.880
The energy of everything else.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.300
OK.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.530
So if the configurational energy
can be separated from

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.070
the sum of all vibration
energies of all the bonds in

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.380
that polymer.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.290
The way that polymer
interacts with --

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:30.840
The way that the solution itself
interacts with itself.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.780
Then if we can do this and we
can do this approximation most

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.000
of the time, then we'll be able
to take the partition

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.590
function for the polymer,
and write it as the

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.610
configurational partition
function times the partition

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.750
function for everything else.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:55.750
And we'll find that this part
here will tend to factor out.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.660
We won't have to
worry about it.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.380
And that this will carry all the
important information that

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.220
we'll need to know to see about
changes in the system.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.055
Changes in Gibbs free
energy, changes in

00:38:07.055 --> 00:38:08.110
the chemical potential.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:12.620
Everything will be related to
this partition function.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.060
This subsystem.

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:19.575
And because of the fact that you
can factor them out, then

00:38:19.575 --> 00:38:21.770
this thing will end
up dropping out.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:30.310
And this will become the
important factor.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.970
OK.

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:55.860
Let's do a quick example.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.100
OK.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:00.670
So this is the example
of having a

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.260
very very, short polymer.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.330
Containing three monomers.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:13.850
Which can be in two
configurations.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:17.060
And the energies are the same
for these two configurations.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:21.200
So the configurational partition
function, which you

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:26.690
would generally write as the sum
of e to the minus Ei for

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.680
that configuration, divided
by kT, plus e to the --

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.500
So we would usually write it as
e to the minus epsilon one

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:38.373
over kT, plus e to the
minus epsilon two

00:39:38.373 --> 00:39:41.100
over kT, plus et cetera.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.890
They're all the same energy.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.780
And there are two
configurations.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.950
The degeneracy is two.

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.640
So you can write this as
the degeneracy of the

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.820
configuration, times the energy
of the configuration.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:00.070
And you can set your energy
reference to be zero.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:01.870
You can choose whatever
you want it to be.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.170
And zero is a good number.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.380
So that e to the zero
is equal to one.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.980
So that configuration partition
function is just the

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:23.060
degeneracy, which is equal to
two, in this case here.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:32.740
So now let's calculate the
molecular and canonical

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:38.760
partition functions for
an ideal gas of

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.540
these molecules here.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.600
And it's usually interesting
to use a

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.110
lattice model as a guide.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:50.960
And so in this lattice model
here, you would divide space

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:55.040
up into little cells.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.940
Pieces in two dimensions, but
in reality it would be three

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:58.800
dimensions.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.510
And then you place your
molecules in lattice sites.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.470
Something like this.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.280
And then you end up counting
the number of ways of

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.810
arranging the molecules
on the lattice.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:16.540
And let's say that we have
N molecules that

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.930
are in the gas phase.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:26.580
And the molecular volume, i.e.
the size of the lattice site

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:31.310
is v. That's the molecular
volume.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:36.640
And N times v is the
total volume.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.970
That's the total volume occupied
by the particles.

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:43.970
The total volume is the number
of lattice sites.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:56.500
V is the total volume.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.620
And we're going to assume that
all particles, all molecules

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.890
have the same translation
energy.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.850
It's an adequate
approximation.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.790
We're going to set that
equal to zero.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:12.770
So all molecules at any position
here has the same E

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.590
translation.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:20.590
And we're going to set
that equal to zero.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:23.400
So the translational
partition function.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:33.750
The molecular transitional
partition function is --

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.420
Well there's only one energy.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.930
It's zero.

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:40.020
So we only care about the
degeneracy of that molecule.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.800
That molecule could be in here,
or it could be here, it

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.920
could be here, it could
be here, it could

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.370
be anywhere, right?

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:52.910
The number of ways of putting
that molecule on the lattice

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.310
is the number of lattice
sites available.

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.200
Which is basically the
molecular volume.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.750
Which is the total
volume divided by

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.720
the molecular volume.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:15.580
The total volume is -- right.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:23.870
So the total volume is the
number of lattice sites times

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.980
the volume of each
lattice site.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:30.420
So the total volume divided by
the small volume is the total

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.030
number of lattice sites.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.630
And the number of choices of
putting that one molecule is

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:39.470
anywhere on the lattice.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:44.330
That's your degeneracy.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:50.810
So now if I look at the total
molecular partition function,

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.710
it's going to be the
multiplication of the

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:55.640
configurational partition
function and the translational

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.260
partition function.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:18.100
At each site, the molecule could
have two configurations.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:22.280
So q, for the molecule, that's
q translational.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.710
I'm going to ignore
all vibrations,

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:24.430
rotation, et cetera.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:26.470
I'm going to assume that there
are two degrees of freedom.

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:29.430
Translational one, which is
basically the positional one.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.340
And then the configurational
one, which is

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:36.170
internal to the molecule.

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:39.880
So this one is V over v.
That's the degeneracy.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.400
Capital V over little v. The
degeneracy of placing the

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.580
molecule on the lattice.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:49.970
And the configuration is
the degeneracy of how

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.440
the molecule folds.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:52.750
Yes.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:45:01.730
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.980
PROFESSOR: The notes
are wrong.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:10.390
So usually capital V is large
and little v is small.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:12.920
So in the notes, if we
have it in reverse,

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:18.620
we should fix that.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.410
This is lecture 25, right?

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:22.840
So we have q.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.930
No the notes seem to be right.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:31.720
Total volume is capital V,
molecular volume is little v.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.170
Where is it that wrong
in the notes?

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:46.030
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.870
PROFESSOR: Oh look at that.

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:51.130
My notes are different
than yours.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:53.910
My notes are right.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.060
OK well it's obviously
right on the web.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.720
Because this is the
latest version.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.440
Alright so flip those big
V's and little v's then.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:03.770
Huh.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:08.530
I thought they were from
the same pile.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:08.860
OK.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:15.000
So this is your molecular
partition function.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.420
And then when you look at the
system, the system partition

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:24.510
function can also be separated
into a translation and the

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:27.650
configuration for the system.

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:31.020
We know what you need to do
is take all the molecular

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:36.360
partition functions, the
transitional ones, and -- to

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.010
the N factor.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:39.930
The number of particles.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.230
But now you have degeneracy.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:45.070
You've over counted.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:50.000
So you need to divide
this N factorial.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.130
You also have the system
partition function for the

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:56.190
configurations.

00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:02.250
And that's q configuration to
the N. Except here we don't

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:04.280
need to divide by one over N
factorial, because we're not

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.390
over counting here.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:13.840
The over counting only happens
when you're placing identical

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:18.310
particles in a lattice, and
you can swap them without

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:19.950
making a difference.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.950
Here we talking about
configurations.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:23.420
When we're talking about
configurations, we're not

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.660
talking about placing the
identical particles in

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:27.440
different spots.

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:31.390
We're just looking at these
two configurations here.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.590
And then the next particle
is two configurations.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:37.550
The next particle is
two configurations.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:38.680
So this is really important.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.200
That this N over factorial
only comes into play when

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:41.890
you're talking about the

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.790
translational degree of freedom.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:46.380
Not the other degrees
of freedom.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.880
And now the total system
partition function is the

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.080
multiplication of these two.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:57.290
It ends up being capital V over
v, to the N power, over N

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:59.820
factorial, times

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:07.200
two to the N. OK.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.970
In general you could extend
this analysis to include

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:15.420
vibrations, rotations, energy
in a magnetical field,

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.510
electric field, et cetera.

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:24.400
Any questions?

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.520
Alright the next thing that
you're going to do then is to

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:31.480
use this concept, as a sort of
example, as a way to begin to

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.010
calculate things that you've
already calculated before.

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:38.570
For instance, if you look at an
expansion of an ideal gas,

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:41.740
can we now calculate
the entropy change.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:45.120
Not based on thermodynamics,
but based on

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.330
the statistical mechanics.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:49.410
On the microscopic description
that we've just gone through.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:53.110
And it turns out that
that's what happens.

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:54.030
That you can do that.

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:55.090
You get the same answer.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:57.430
Thank god you get
the same answer.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:00.680
Otherwise we'd be
in big trouble.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.446
So I'm just going to set up the
problem, because I won't

00:49:02.446 --> 00:49:03.570
have time to do it.

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:06.010
And then you can do it next
time, when Keith comes back.

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:11.990
So the problem is going to be
the usual problem of having a

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:20.870
volume V1 of a gas on one side,
and a vaccuum expanding

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:23.420
to volume V2, gas.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:29.700
And asking what is the
entropy change.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:37.000
And you know that from thermo,
that delta S in this case here

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.190
is nR log V2 over V1, when the
temperature is constant.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:44.050
That's going to be our answer.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:45.580
It has to be our answer.

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.340
But this time, instead of
knowing the answer, we're

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:51.040
going to calculate it
from microscopics.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.550
So what you do is you start out
with your initial state.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:50:01.080
You ask what is -- you write
down the molecular volume V.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.330
The total volume here is V1.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:14.420
You assume that all molecules
have the same

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.830
translational energy.

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:17.380
You set that equal to zero.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.700
The system translational energy
is equal to zero.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:26.910
And so the entropy for this gas
here is just the number of

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:30.540
ways of placing the molecule
in the lattice.

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:34.730
This model that we have of space
being separated into

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:35.880
little cells.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:43.380
And so S is k log omega, where
omega is the number of ways of

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.480
placing the molecules
in the lattice.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:50.230
Which is basically k log V,
over v. Where this is the

00:50:50.230 --> 00:51:03.170
number of lattice sites.

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:05.940
OK.

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:07.370
And what you're going to
do next time, then,

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:10.250
is start from here.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:11.640
Calculate what it is before.

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.020
Calculate what it is after, and
turn the crank, and get to

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:16.770
the right answer.

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:19.070
Then you're going to do the
same thing for liquids.

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:25.590
And that'll be it for this
simple statistical mechanics.
