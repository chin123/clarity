00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.900
PROFESSOR: So last time we
talked about the zeroth law,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.440
which is the common-sense law,
which says that if you take a

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.460
hot object next to a cold
object, heat will flow from

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.320
the hot to the cold in a way
that is well defined, and it

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.500
allows you to define
temperature.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.390
It allows you to define the
concept of a thermometer.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.890
You have three objects, one of
them could be a thermometer.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.620
You have two of them separated
at a distance.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920
You take the third one, and you
go from one to the other,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.550
and you see whether heat flows,
when you touch one

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.640
object, the middle object,
between those two objects.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.680
Let me talk to you about
temperature scales.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.030
We talked about the
Celsius scale then

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.000
the Fahrenheit scale.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.270
The late 1800's were a booming
time for temperature scales.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.380
People didn't really realize
how important it was to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.310
properly define the reference
points: Fahrenheit's

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:24.020
warm-blooded or 96 degrees,
and Romer's 7.5 degrees.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.310
Romer because he didn't want
to go below zero degrees

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.870
measuring temperature
outside in Denmark

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.540
Those are kind of silly.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.260
But they're the legacy that
we have today, and

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.230
that's what we use.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.180
In science, we use somewhat
better temperature scales.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.690
And the temperature scale that
turns out to be well-defined

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.410
and ends up giving us the
concept of an absolute zero is

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.660
the ideal gas thermometer.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:03.550
So, let's talk about that
briefly today first.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.880
The ideal gas thermometer.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.250
It's based on Boyle's law.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.330
Boyle's law was an empirical law
that Mr. Boyle discovered

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.750
by doing lots of experiments,
and Boyle's law says that the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.640
limit of the quantity pressure
times the molar volume, so

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.030
this quantity here, pressure
times the molar volume, as you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.020
let pressure go to zero.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.250
So, you do this measurement, you
measure with the gas, you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.930
measure the pressure and
the molar volume.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.410
Then you change the pressure
again, and you measure the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.140
pressure in the volume, and
you multiply these two

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.530
together, and you keep doing
this experiment, getting the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.700
pressure smaller and smaller,
you find that this limit turns

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.610
out to be a constant,
independent of the gas.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.610
It doesn't care where
the gas is.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.570
You always get to the
same constant.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.440
And that constant turns out
to be a function of the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.320
temperature.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.910
The only function it is -- it
doesn't care where the gas is.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.000
It only cares where the
temperature is.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.840
All right, so now we have the
makings of a good thermometer

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.380
and a good temperature scale.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.010
We have a substance.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.290
The substance could
be any gas.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.620
That's pretty straightforward.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.040
So now we have a substance,
which is

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.070
a gas, with a property.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.300
So now the volume of mercury,
or the color of something

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.890
which changes with temperature,
or the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.820
resistivity.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.120
In this case here, our property
is the value of the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.980
pressure times the volume,
times the molar volume.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.210
That's the property.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.200
The property is the limit as p
goes to zero of pressure times

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.580
molar volume.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.990
It's a number.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.400
Measure it.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.860
It's a number.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.520
It's going to come out.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.500
That's the property that's going
to give us the change in

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.040
temperature.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.850
Then we need some reference
points.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:20.580
And Celsius first used the
boiling point of water, and

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.110
called that 100 degrees Celsius,
and the freezing

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:32.410
point of water and called that
zero degrees Celsius.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.870
And then we need an
interpolation scale.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.550
How to go from one reference
point to the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.660
other with this property.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.490
This property, which we're
going to call f(t).

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.740
There are many ways you can
connect those two dots.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.560
If I draw a graph, and on one
axis I have this temperature.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.210
The idea of temperature with two
reference points, zero for

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.210
the freezing point of water,
100 degrees for the boiling

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.170
point of water.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.120
And on the y-axis I've got
the property f(t).

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.070
It has some value

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.000
corresponding to t equals zero.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.110
So let's get some value
right here.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.070
There's another value connected
to this property

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.460
here, when t is equal to 100,
a reference point here.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.740
Now there many ways
I can connect

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.930
these two points together.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.940
The simplest way is to
draw a straight line.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.480
It's called the linear
interpolation.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.020
My line is not so straight,
right here.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.470
You could do a different
kind of line.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.760
You could do a quadratic,
let's say.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.040
Something like this.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.860
That would be perfectly
fine interpolation.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:58.390
All right, we choose to have
a linear interpolation.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.630
That's a choice, and that choice
turns out to be very

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.930
interesting and really
important, because if you

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.490
connect these two points
together, you get a straight

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:19.520
line that has to intercept
the x-axis at some point.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.290
Now what does it mean to
intercept the x-axis here?

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.510
It means that the value
of f(t) for this

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.000
temperature is zero.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.120
That means that at this point
right here, f(t)=0.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.120
That means the pressure times
the volume equals

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.890
zero, for that gas.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.160
And if you're below this
temperature here, this

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.100
quantity, p times v it
would be negative.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.050
Is that possible?

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.540
Can we have p v negative?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.470
Yes?

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.020
No, it can't be.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.720
Negative pressure doesn't
make any sense, right?

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.030
Negative volume doesn't
make any sense.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.860
That means that this part
here, can't happen.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.840
That means that this temperature
right here is the

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.610
absolute lowest temperature you
can go to that physically

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.920
makes any sense.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.770
That's the absolute zero.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.580
So the concept of an absolute
zero, a temperature below

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:34.130
which you just can't go, that's
directly out of the

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.210
scheme here, this linear
interpolation scheme with

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.540
these two reference points.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.770
If I had taken as my
interpolation scheme, my white

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:47.750
curve here, I could go to
infinity and have the

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.830
equivalent of absolute
zero being at

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.530
infinity, minus infinity.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:59.060
So, this temperature, this
absolute zero here, which is

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:04.300
absolute zero on the
Kelvin scale.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.990
The lowest possible temperature
in the Celsius

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:13.190
scale is minus 273.15
degrees Celsius.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:19.720
So that begs the notion of
re-referencing our reference

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.060
point, of changing our
reference points.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.180
To change a reference point
from this point here being

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.290
zero, instead of this point
here being zero.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.180
And so redefining then the
temperature scale to the

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:41.550
Kelvin scale, where t in degrees
Kelvin is equal to t

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:50.040
in degree Celsius,
plus 273.15.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.200
And then you would get
the Kelvin scale.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.760
All right, it turned out that
this thermometer here wasn't

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.450
quite perfect either.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:07.480
Just like Fahrenheit measuring
96 degrees being a

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.670
warm-blooded, healthy
man, right,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.540
that's not very accurate.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.590
Our temperature probably
fluctuates during the day a

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.720
little bit anyways, it's
not very accurate.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.960
And similarly, the boiling
point, defining that at a 100

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.730
degrees Celsius, well that
depends on the pressure.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.330
It depends whether you're in
Denver or you're in Boston.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.790
Water boils at different
temperatures, depending on

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.800
what the atmospheric pressure
is; same thing for the

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.130
freezing point.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.650
So that means, then, you've
got to define the pressure

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.050
pretty well.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.790
You've got to know where
the pressure is.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.190
It would be much better if you
had a reference point that

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.560
didn't care where the
pressure was.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.340
Just like our substance doesn't
care where the gas is.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.020
It's kind of universal.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.460
And so now, instead of using
these reference points for the

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:01.490
Kelvin scale, we use the
absolute zero, which isn't

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.630
going to care what
the pressure is.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.340
It's the lowest number
you can go to.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.890
And our other reference point
is the triple point of water

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:18.460
-- reference points become zero
Kelvin, absolute zero,

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.870
and the triple point.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.100
The triple point of water is
going to be defined as 273.16

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.080
degrees Kelvin.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.050
And the triple point of water
is that temperature and

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.790
pressure -- there's a unique
temperature and pressure where

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:44.180
water exists in equilibrium
between the liquid phase, the

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.230
vapor phase, and the
solid phase.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:57.010
So the triple point is liquid,
solid, gas, all in

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.750
equilibrium.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.740
Now you may think, well
I've seen that before.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.390
You take a glass of ice
water and set it down.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.290
There's the water phase, there's
the ice cube is the

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:15.310
solid phase, and there's
some water, gas, vapor,

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:16.770
and that's one bar.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.830
Where am I going wrong here?

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:25.620
The partial pressure of the
water, of gaseous water, above

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.360
that equilibrium of ice
and water is not one

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.650
bar, it's much less.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:38.920
So the partial pressure or the
pressure by which you have

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:46.140
this triple point, happens
to be 6.1 times 10

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.040
to the minus 3 bar.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.960
There's hardly any vapor
pressure above

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:55.530
your ice water glass.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:00.800
So this unique temperature and
unique pressure defines a

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.930
triple point everywhere,
and that's a

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.110
great reference point.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.970
Any questions?

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:11.300
Great.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.775
So now we have this ideal gas
thermometer, and out of this

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:18.780
ideal gas thermometer, also
comes out the ideal gas law.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.510
Because we can take our
interpolation here, our linear

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:29.110
interpolation, the slope
of this line.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.020
Let's draw it in degrees
Kelvin, instead

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.400
of in degrees Celsius.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.670
So we have now temperature
in degrees Kelvin.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.150
We have the quantity
f(t) here.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:50.480
We have an interpolation scheme
between zero and 273.16

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.710
with two values for this
quantity, and we have a linear

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.760
interpolation that defines our
temperature scale, our Kelvin

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.350
temperature scale.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:07.150
And so the slope of this thing
is f(t) at the triple point,

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.120
which is this point here, this
is the temperature of the

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:16.650
triple point of water,
divided by 273.16.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.710
That's the slope of that line.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:25.660
The quantity here, which is
f (t of the triple point),

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:33.480
divided by the value
of the x-axis here.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.080
So that's the slope, and the
intercept is zero, so the

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:45.730
function f(t), you just
multiply by t here.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:50.250
This is the slope. f(t)
is just the limit.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:56.910
As p goes to zero of
p times v bar.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.080
And so now we have this
quantity, p times v bar, and

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.350
the limit of p goes to zero is
equal to a constant times the

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.500
temperature.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.200
That's a universal statement.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.050
It's true of every gas.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.410
I didn't say this is only true
of hydrogen or nitrogen, This

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:20.890
is any gas because I'm taking
this limit p equals to zero.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.370
Now this constant is
just a constant.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.250
I'm going to call it r.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.760
I'm going to call it r.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.520
It's going to be the gas
constant, and now I have r

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:37.950
times t is equal to the limit,
p goes to zero of p r.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:44.700
It's true for any gas, and if I
remove this limit here, r t

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:52.600
is equal to p v bar, I'm going
to call that an ideal gas.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.020
See, this is the property
of an ideal gas.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.760
What does it mean, ideal gas?

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.200
It means that the molecules or
the atoms and the gas don't

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.110
know about each other.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.670
They effectively
have no volume.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.170
They have no interactions
with each other.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.290
They occupy the same
volume in space.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.230
They don't care that there
are other atoms

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.900
and molecules around.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.280
So that's basically what
you do when you

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.890
take p goes to zero.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.360
You make the volume infinitely
large, the density of the gas

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.820
infinitely small.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.990
The atoms or molecules in the
gas don't know that there are

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.880
other atoms and molecules in the
gas, and then you end up

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.360
with this universal property.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.040
All right, so gases that have
this universal property, even

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.810
when the pressure is not zero,
those are the ideal gases.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.450
And for the sake of this class,
we're going to consider

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.860
most gases to be ideal gases.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.690
Questions?

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:50.530
So now, this equation here
relates three state functions

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.010
together: the pressure, the
volume, and the temperature.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.510
Now, if you remember, we said
that if you had a substance,

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.100
if you knew the number of moles
and two properties, you

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.180
knew everything about the gas.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:11.040
Which means that you can
re-write this in the form,

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.250
volume, for instance, is equal
to the function of n, p, t..

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:26.660
In this case, V = (nRT)/P. Have
two quantities and the

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.930
number of moles gives you
another property.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.280
You don't need to
know the volume.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.690
All you need to know is the
pressure and temperature and

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.200
the number of moles
to get the volume.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.340
This is called an equation
of state.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:43.530
It relate state properties
to each other.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.270
In this case it relates the
volume to the pressure and the

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.120
temperature.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:55.220
Now, if you're an engineer, and
you use the ideal gas law

00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:01.160
to design a chemical plant or
a boiler or an electrical

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.420
plant, you know, a steam plant,
you're going to be in

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.740
big trouble.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:14.080
Your plant is going to blow up,
because the ideal gas law

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.890
works only in very small range
of pressures and temperatures

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.480
for most gases.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:25.110
So, we have other equations
of states for real gases.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.440
This is an equation of state
for an ideal gases.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.280
For real gases, there's a whole
bunch of equation the

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.805
states that you can find in
textbooks, and I'm just going

00:17:33.805 --> 00:17:37.620
to go through a few of them.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.610
The first one uses something
called a

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:45.020
compressibility factor, z.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.280
Compressibility factor, z.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.620
And instead of writing PV = RT,
which would be the ideal

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.580
gas law, we put a fudge
factor in there.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.620
And the fudge factor
is called z.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.460
Now we can put real instead of
ideal for our volume. z is the

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:11.050
compressibility factor, and z is
the ratio of the volume of

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.310
the real gas divided
by what it would be

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:21.240
were it an ideal gas.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:27.120
So, if z is less than 1, then
the real gas is more compact

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.920
then the ideal gas.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.320
It's a smaller volume.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.230
If z is greater than 1, then
the real gas means that the

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.090
atoms and molecules in the real
gas are repelling each

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:40.270
other and wants to have
a bigger volume.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.490
And you can find these

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.190
compressibility factors in tables.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.560
If you want to know the
compressibility factors for

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.180
water, for steam, at a certain
pressure and temperature, you

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.420
go to a table and you find it.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:58.800
So that's one example of a
real equation of state.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.920
Not a very useful one for our
purposes in this class here.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.370
Another one is the
virial expansion.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.920
It's a little bit more useful.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.060
What you do is you take that
fudge factor, and you expand

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.490
it out into a Taylor series.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:23.306
So, we have the p v real
over r t is equal to z.

00:19:23.306 --> 00:19:28.200
Now, we're going to take z and
say all right, under most

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.610
conditions, it's pretty close to
1, when it's an ideal gas.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:37.620
And then we have to add
corrections to that, and the

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.320
corrections are going to
be more important, the

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.190
larger the volume is.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.686
Remember, it's the limit of p
times v goes to zero, so if

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:50.800
you have a large volume with a
large pressure, then you're

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.240
out of the ideal gas regime.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:20:00.100
So let's take Taylor series in
one over the volume, it's

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.070
going to be one over the volume
squared, etcetera.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.370
And these factors on top, which
are going to depend on

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.900
the temperature, are the virial
coefficients, and those

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.070
depend on the substance.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.660
So you have this p B(t) here.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:25.040
This is called a second
virial coefficient.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.700
And then, so you can get,
you can actually find a

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.080
graph of this B(t).

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.240
It's going to look something
like this.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:39.130
It's the function of
temperature, as B(t).

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.690
There's going to be some
temperature where B(t) is

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:42.060
equal to zero.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.970
In that case, your gas is
going to look awfully

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:46.570
like an ideal gas.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.960
Above some temperature is going
to be positive, below

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.790
some temperature is going
to be negative.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.630
Generally, we ignore the
high order terms here.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.320
So again, if you do a
calculation where you're close

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.567
enough to the ideal gas, and
you need to design your, if

00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:07.050
you have an engineer designing
something that's got a bunch

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:13.590
of gases around, this is
a useful thing to use.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:18.480
Now, the most interesting one
for our class, the equation of

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.700
state that's the most
interesting, is the Van der

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.976
Waals equation of state,
developed by Mr. Van

00:21:24.976 --> 00:21:29.230
der Waals in 1873.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.320
And the beauty of that equation
of state is that it

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:37.460
only relies on two parameters.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.700
So let's build it up.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.090
Let's see where it comes from.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.400
Let me just first write it
down, the Van der Waals

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:53.480
equation of state. p plus a over
v bar squared times v bar

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.390
minus b equals r t.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:02.030
All right, if you take a equal
to zero, these are the two

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.250
parameters, a and b.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.250
If you take those two equal
to zero, you have p v

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:05.960
is equal to r t.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.950
That's the ideal gas law.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.780
Let's build this up.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.745
Let's see where this comes from,
where these parameters a

00:22:11.745 --> 00:22:14.110
and b comes from.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.560
So, the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.360
take our gas in our box,
let's build a box

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.770
full of gases here.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.760
We've got a bunch of gas
molecules or atoms.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:30.230
OK, there's the volume
of a box here.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.440
While these gas molecules
or atoms through first

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.770
approximation, are like
hard spheres.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.390
They occupy a certain volume.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:45.020
Each atom or molecule occupies
a particular volume.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:58.370
And so, we can call b is the
volume per mole of the hard

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:06.390
spheres, volume per mole that is
the little sphere that the

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:07.760
molecules are.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.790
So that the volume that is
available to any one of those

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.880
spheres is actually smaller than
v. Because you've got all

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.570
these other little spheres
around, so the actual volume

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.180
seen by any one of those spheres
is smaller than v. So

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:29.250
when we take our ideal gas law,
p v bar is equal to r t

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.790
we have to replace v bar by the
actual volume available to

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.030
this hard sphere.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:42.110
So instead of v bar, we write
p v bar minus b, equal r t.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:47.890
OK, that's the hard sphere
volume of the spheres.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:52.770
Now, those molecules or atoms
that are in here, also feel

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:53.640
each other.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.680
There are a whole bunch of
forces that you learn in

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.390
5.112, 5.111 like with Van
der Waals' attractions

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:58.280
and things like this.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:04.320
So there are attractive forces,
or repulsive forces

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:13.090
that these molecules feel, and
that's going to change the

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.280
pressure that the
molecules feel.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.480
For instance, if I have,
what is pressure?

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.330
Pressure is when you have one
of these hard spheres

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.410
colliding against the wall.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.950
There's the hard sphere.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.300
It wants to collide against the
wall to create a force on

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.150
the wall, and I have a couple
of the hard spheres that are

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.090
nearby, right, and in the
absence of any interactions, I

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:34.900
get a certain pressure.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.210
This thing would but careen
into the wall, kaboom!

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:41.750
You'd have this little force,
but in the presence of these

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.190
interactions, you've got these
other molecules here that are

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:51.630
watching this, you know, their
partner sort of wants to do

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.112
damage to themselves, like
hitting that wall,

00:24:54.112 --> 00:24:54.830
and they say, no!

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.600
Come back, come back, right?

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.470
There is an attractive force.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.130
There are no other molecules
on that side of the wall.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.980
So there's an attractive force
that makes the velocity within

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:05.960
not quite as fast.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.710
The force is not quite as strong
as it was without this

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:09.570
attractive force.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:13.040
So the real pressure is not
quite the same because of this

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.020
attractive force as it was,
as it would be without the

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.170
attractive forces.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.840
The pressure is a little bit
less in this case here.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.270
So instead of this p here.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:30.370
Now if I re-write this equation
here as p is equal to

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:35.980
r t divided by v bar minus
b, just re-writing this

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.260
equation as it is.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.540
So the pressure is going to
depend on how strong this

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:46.680
attractive force is.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.880
So the pressure is going to be
less if there's a strong

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.150
attractive force.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.680
And the 1 over v squared is a
statistical, is basically a

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.800
probability of having another
molecule, a second molecule in

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.240
the volume of space.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.970
So, if the molar volume is
small, then one over v bar is

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.190
large, there's a large
probability of having two

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:13.180
spheres together in
the same volume.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.480
If the molar volume is large,
that means that there's a lot

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.630
of room for the molecules, and
they're now going to be close

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.760
to each other, and
so this isn't

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.570
going to be as important.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:26.620
So, a is the strength of the
interaction, v bar is how

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.710
likely they are to be
close to each other.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:30.840
And that's going to
affect the actual

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.220
pressure seen by the gas.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:43.020
And a is greater than zero when
you have the attraction.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.980
And that gives use the Van der
Waals' equation of state, with

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.650
two parameters, the hard
sphere volume and the

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.970
attraction.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.930
You don't have to go look
up in tables or books.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.830
You don't have to have all the
values of the second virial

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:01.490
coefficient, or the fudge
factor, just two variables

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:04.750
that make physical sense, and
you get an equation of state

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.060
which is a reasonable equation
of state, and that's the power

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.500
of the Van der Waals' equation
of state, and that's the one

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.080
we're going to be using
later on this class to

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.100
describe real gases.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.530
Question?

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.740
OK, so we've done
the zeroth law.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.540
We've done temperature,
equations of state.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.040
We're ready for the first law.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.410
We're just going to go to
through these laws pretty

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.560
quickly here.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.330
Remember, the first law
is the upbeat law.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.910
It's the one that says,
hey, you know,

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.790
life is all rosy here.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:42.275
We can take energy from fossil
fuels and burn it up and make

00:27:42.275 --> 00:27:46.540
it heat, and change that
energy into work.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.460
And it's the same energy, and
we probably can do that with

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.310
100% efficiency.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.560
We can take heat from the air
surrounding us and run our car

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.350
on it with 100% efficiency.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.570
Is this possible?

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.620
That's what the first law says,
it's possible; work is

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.570
heat, and heat is work, and
they're the same thing.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.650
You can break even, maybe.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.760
So let's go back and
see what work is.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:17.640
Let's go back to our
freshman physics.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:24.220
Work, work is if you take a
force, and you push something

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.770
a certain distance,
you do work on it.

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:32.670
So if I take my chalk here and
I push on it, I'm doing work

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:33.890
to push that chalk.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:37.980
Force times distance is work.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.080
The applied force times
the distance.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.370
There are many kinds of work.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.700
There's electrical work, take
the motor, you plug it into

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.140
the wall, electricity makes
the fan go around, that's

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.170
electrical work.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.830
There's magnetic work.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:55.920
There is work due to gravity.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.210
In this class here, we're going
to stick to one kind of

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:03.690
work which is expansion work.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.360
So expansion work, for instance,
or compression work,

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.870
is if you have a piston
with a gas in it.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:15.040
All right, you put a pressure
on this piston here, and you

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.470
compress the gas down.

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.470
This is compression work.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:26.150
Now the volume gets smaller.
p external here.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:30.180
Pressure, the piston goes
down by some volume l.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:35.740
The piston has a cross-sectional
area, a, and

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:41.990
the force -- pressure is
force per volume area.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:48.210
So the force that you're pushing
down on here is the

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.190
external pressure
times the area.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.120
Pressure is force
per volume area.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.870
That's the force you're
using to push down.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:03.880
Now the work that's it is
calculated when you push down

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.560
with the pressure on this piston
here, that work is

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:19.500
force times distance, f times
I. f is p external times a,

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.820
times the distance l.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:27.130
So that's p external times
the change in the volume.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:32.230
The area times this distance is
a volume, and that is the

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.120
change in volume from going
to the initial state

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.240
to the final state.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.540
Now we need to have
a convention.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.650
We've got force.

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:44.690
Work is force times distance,
it's p external times delta v,

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.000
and I'm going to be stressing
a lot that this is the

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:47.860
external pressure.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.710
This is the pressure that you're
applying against the

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:54.310
piston, not the pressure
of the gas.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:58.270
It's the pressure the external
world is applying on this poor

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.290
system here.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.950
OK, but we need a
convention here.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.180
The convention, and then
we need to stick to it.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.890
And this convention,
unfortunately, has changed

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:08.700
over the ages.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.280
But we're going to pick one,
and we're going to stick to

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.740
it, which is that if the
environment does work on the

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:22.020
system, if we push down on this
thing and do work on it,

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:32.790
to compress it, then we call
that work negative work.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:38.130
No, we call that work
positive work.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.230
All right, so that means we need
to put a negative sign

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:48.610
right here, by convention.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:56.090
So if delta v is negative, in
this case delta v is negative,

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.540
OK, delta v is negative,
pressure is a positive number,

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:02.520
negative times negative
is positive, work is

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.070
greater than zero.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:09.520
We're doing work on the
system, to the system.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.480
In this case here,
work is positive.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.920
If you have expansion on the
other side, if the system is

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.830
expanding in the other
direction, if you're going

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:27.890
this way, right, you're going to
do work to the environment.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.710
There might be a mass here.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:30.650
This could be a car.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.360
Pistons in the car, right,
so the piston goes up.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.980
That's going to drive
the wheels.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.210
The car is going
to go forward.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.780
You're doing work on
the environment.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.700
Delta v is going to
be negative. w

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.320
is going to be negative.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.650
Sorry, I got it backwards
again.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:46.710
Delta v is positive
in this direction

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.100
here, the work is negative.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:55.060
So work on the system
is positive.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.570
Work done by the system
is negative.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.850
Convention, OK, this negative
sign is just a pure

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.760
convention.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.760
You just got to use
it all the time.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.150
If you use an old textbook,
written when I was taking

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.430
thermodynamics, they have the
opposite convention, and it's

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.410
very confusing.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:15.360
But now we've all agreed on this
convention, and work is

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.450
going to be with the
negative sign here.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:25.910
OK, any questions?

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.990
This is an example where the
external pressure here is kept

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:31.610
fixed as the volume changes,
but it doesn't

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.140
have to be kept fixed.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.060
I could change my external
pressure through the whole

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.560
process, and that's the path.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.190
We talked about the path last
time being very important.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.670
Defining the path.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:46.850
So if I have a path where my
pressure is changing, then I

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.920
can't go directly from
this large volume

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.630
to this small volume.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:55.730
I have to go in little steps,
infinitely small steps.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:34:00.260
So, instead of writing work is
the negative of p external

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:07.810
times delta v, I'm going to
write a differential. dw is

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:14.040
minus p external dv, where this
depends on the path, it

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.800
depends on path and is changing
as v and p change.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.620
Now I'm going to add a
little thing here.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.790
I'm going to put a little
bar right here.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:31.010
And the little bar here means
that this dw that I'm putting

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:37.440
here is not an exact
differential.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.070
What do I mean by that?

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:45.890
I mean that if I take the
integral of this to find out

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:50.070
how much work I've done
on the system, I

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.060
need to know the path.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.550
That's what this means here.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:58.450
It's not enough to know the
initial state and the final

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.630
state to find what w is.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.880
You also need to know
how you got there.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.990
This is very different from the
functions of state, like

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.360
pressure and temperature.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.690
There's a volume, there's
a temperature, than

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.150
the pressure here.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.810
There's other volume,
temperature and pressure here,

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.660
corresponding to this
system here.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.600
And this volume, temperature and
pressure doesn't care how

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.890
you got there.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:23.540
It is what it is.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.720
It defines the state
of the system.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.090
The amount of work you've
put in to get here

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.260
depends on the path.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.800
It's not a function of state.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.260
It's not an exact
differential.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.510
So the delta v here is an
exact differential,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.390
but this dw is not.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.910
That's going to be
really important.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.130
So if you want to find out how
much work you've done, you

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:49.050
take the integral from the
initial state to the final

00:35:49.050 --> 00:36:01.350
state of dw minus from one to
two p external dv, and you've

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:05.630
got to know what the path is.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:15.220
So let's look at this path
dependence briefly here.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:20.280
We're going to do two different
paths, and see how

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.420
they're different in terms of
the work that comes out.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.220
So we're going to take an ideal
gas, we can assume that

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:28.750
it's ideal.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.990
Let's take argon, for
instance, a nice,

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.200
non-interacting gas.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.530
We're going to do
a compression.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:41.640
We're going to take argon, with
a certain gas, certain

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.640
pressure p1, volume V1, and
we're going to a final state

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:50.520
argon, gas, p2, V2.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:58.730
Where V1 is greater than V2,
and p1 is less than p2.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:07.650
So if I draw this on a p
v diagram, so there is

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.090
volume on this axis.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.510
There's pressure on this axis.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:13.170
There is V1 here.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:15.160
There's V2 here.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.610
There's p1 here, and p2 here.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:20.410
So I'm starting at p1, V1.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:25.960
I'm starting right here.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:30.870
And I'm going to
end right here.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.610
Initial find -- there are many
ways I can get from one state

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:35.860
to the other.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:40.660
Draw any sort of line
to go here, right?

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.400
There are a couple obvious ones,
which we're going to --

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.730
we can calculate, which
we're going to do.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:52.450
So, the first obvious one
is to take V1 to V2

00:37:52.450 --> 00:38:01.240
first with p constant.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.190
So take this path here.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:08.000
I take V1 to V2 first, keeping
the pressure constant at p1,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.440
then I take p1 to p2 keeping
the volume constant at V2.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.770
Let's call this path 1.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:21.690
Then you take p1 to p2
with V constant.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:31.440
An isobaric process followed by
a constant volume process.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.070
You could also do a
different path.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:42.580
You could do, let me draw p v,
there's my initial state.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:47.860
My final state here, I could
take, first, I could change

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.920
the pressure, and then
change the volume.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:59.390
So the second process, if you
take p1 to p2, V constant, and

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:04.140
then you take V1 to V2
with p constant.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:10.200
This is path number two.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.635
Both are perfectly fine paths,
and I'm going to assume that

00:39:12.635 --> 00:39:15.330
these paths are also
reversible.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:19.970
Let's assume that both are
reversible, meaning that I'm

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:25.230
doing this pretty slowly, so
as I change, let's say I'm

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:30.250
changing my volumes here, V1
to V2, it's happening, I'm

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.070
compressing it slowly, slowly,
slowly so that at any point I

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:39.340
could reverse the process
without losing energy, right?

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:47.070
It's always an equilibrium.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:51.770
All right, let's calculate the
work that's involved with

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:55.100
these two processes.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.870
Remember it's the external
pressure that's important.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:02.420
In this case, because it's
a reversible process, the

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:06.050
external pressure turns out to
be always the same as the

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.230
internal pressure.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:13.860
It's reversible, that means
that p external, equals p.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.330
I'm doing it very slowly so that
I'm always in equilibrium

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.740
between the external pressure
and the internal pressure so I

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:23.240
can go back and forth.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.110
So, let's calculate w1.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.180
The work for path one.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.360
First thing is I change the
volume from V1 to V2 The

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.430
external pressure is kept
constant, p1, so it's minus

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:39.750
the integral from 1,
V1 to V2, p1, dv.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:49.490
And then the next step here is
I'm going from -- the pressure

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:50.270
is changing.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:58.370
I'm going from V2 to V2 dv
-- what do you think this

00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.870
integral is?

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:03.460
Right, so this is easy
part, zero here.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.440
This one is also pretty easy.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:12.470
That's minus p1 times V2 minus
V1. p1 times V2 minus V1.

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:18.650
What that turns out to be,
this area right here.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:19.890
It's V1 minus V2 times p1.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.120
This is w1 here.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:34.170
OK, I can re-write this as p1
time V1 minus V2 and get rid

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.640
of this negative sign here.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:44.230
Now V1 is bigger than V2,
so this is positive.

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:50.060
So I am compressing, I'm doing
work to the system, positive

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.100
work everything follows
our convention.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:42:01.430
Number two here, OK, the first
thing I do is I change the

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:06.600
pressure under constant volume,
V1, V1 minus p dv, and

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.870
then I change the volume
from V1 to V2 and

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:14.460
then this is p2, dv.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:19.050
This first integral is zero V1
to V1, then I get minus p2

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:25.000
times V2 minus V1 or p2
times V1 minus V2.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.090
Again, a positive number.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.760
I'm doing work to the system to
go from the initial state

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.680
to the final state.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.480
But it's not the same as w1.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.520
In this case, I have p1 times
delta V. In this case here, I

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:51.400
have p2 times delta V. And p2
is bigger than p1. w2 is

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:56.710
bigger than w1.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:00.450
The amount of work that you're
doing on the system depends on

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:04.720
the path that you take.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:08.370
All right, how do
I, practically

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:10.600
speaking, how do I do this?

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.960
Anybody have an idea?

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:23.090
How do I keep p1 constant while
I'm lowering the volume?

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.000
STUDENT: Change the
temperature?

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.420
PROFESSOR: Change the
temperature, right.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:31.960
So what I'm doing here is I'm
cooling, and then when I'm

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.870
sitting at a fixed volume and
I'm increasing the pressure,

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:37.890
what am I doing?

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:38.560
I'm heating, right?

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.120
So I'm doing cooling
and heating cycles.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:45.750
So in this case here, I
cool and then I heat.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.710
In this case here, I heat
and then I cool.

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:52.730
All right, so I'm burning some
energy, I'm burning some fuel

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:59.300
to do this somehow, to get
that work to happen.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:05.060
All right, now suppose that I
took these two paths, and

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:11.050
coupled them together.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.880
So in this case, it's the amount
of work is the area

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.630
under that curve.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:17.370
And in this case here, the
amount of work is bigger, w2

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:21.010
is bigger, and it's the
area under this curve.

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:26.670
Now, suppose I took this two
paths, and I took -- couple

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:28.790
them together with one the
reverse of the other.

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:32.970
So I have my initial state, my
final state, my initial state,

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:35.250
my final state here.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:40.310
And I start by taking
my first path here.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:44.770
I cool, I heat.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:46.190
So there's w1.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:52.580
So the w total that I'm going
to get, is w1, and then

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.920
instead of the path from V1
to, from 1 to 2 going like

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:08.150
this as we had before, I'm going
to take it backwards.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.260
If I go backwards, to work --
everything is symmetric, the

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.580
work becomes the negative from
what I had calculated before,

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:21.200
so this becomes minus what I
calculated before for w2.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:29.070
The total work, in this case
here, is p1 times V1 minus p2

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:38.460
times V1 minus V2, it's p1 minus
p2 times V1 minus V2.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.710
This is a positive number,
p1 is smaller than p2.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:43.280
This is a negative number.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:48.240
The total work is
less than zero.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.890
That's the work that the
system is doing to the

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:53.210
environment.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.550
I'm doing work to
the environment.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.830
The work is negative, which
means that work is being done

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:57.780
to the environment.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:07.450
And that work is the area
inside the rectangle.

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:10.720
What you've built
is an engine.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:17.700
You cool, you heat, you heat,
you cool, you get back to the

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.760
same place, but you've just done
work to the environment.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.520
You've just built
a heat engine.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.770
You take fuel, rather you take
something that's warm, and you

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:31.380
put it in contact with the
atmosphere, it cools down.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:34.040
You take your fuel, you
heat it up again.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.390
It expands.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:39.060
You change your constraints on
your system, you heat it up

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:43.520
some more, then you take the
heat source away, and you put

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.250
it back in contact with
the atmosphere.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.726
And you cool it a little bit,
change the constraints, cool

00:46:48.726 --> 00:46:51.050
it a little bit more, and heat,
and you've got a closed

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:53.700
cycle engine.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.860
We're going to work
with some more

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.520
complicated engines before.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.350
But the important part here is
that the work is not zero.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:01.440
You're starting at one point.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.800
You're going around a cycle and
you're going back to the

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.420
same point.

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.410
The pressure, temperature, and
volume are exactly the same

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:08.710
here as when you started out.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:10.080
But the w is not zero.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:15.280
The w, for the closed path, and
when I put a circle there

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.280
on my integral that means a
closed path, when you start

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:26.600
and end at the same point,
right, this is not zero.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.320
If you had an exact
differential, the exact

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.710
differential around a closed
path, you would get zero.

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:36.800
It wouldn't care where
the path is.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:37.960
Here this cares where
the path is.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:44.030
So, work is not a function
of state.

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:53.620
Any questions on work before we
move on to heat, briefly?

00:47:53.620 --> 00:48:05.930
So heat is a quantity that
flows into a substance,

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:08.570
something that flows into a
substance that changes it's

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:13.880
temperature, very
broadly defined.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.250
And, again, we have a sign
convention for heat.

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:20.960
So heat, we're going
to call that q.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.710
And our sign convention is
that if we change our

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:31.930
temperature from T1 to T2, where
T2 it's greater than T1

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:36.990
then heat is going
to be positive.

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:39.900
Heat needs to go into the
system to change the

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:43.100
temperature and make it go up.

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.970
If the temperature of the system
goes down, heat flows

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:48.200
down heat flows out of the
system, and we call that

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.550
negative q.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:54.300
Same convention is
for w, basically.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.000
Now, you can have a change of
temperature without any heat

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.470
being involved.

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:05.010
I can take an insulated box,
and I can have a chemical

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:08.540
reaction in that
insulated box.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.170
I can take a heat pack,
like the kind

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:11.850
you buy at a pharmacy.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:15.110
Break it up.

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.570
It gets hot.

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:20.470
There's no heat flowing from the
environment to the system.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:22.510
I have to define my terms.

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.860
My system is whatever's
inside the box.

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.380
It's insulated.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.220
It's a closed system.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.090
In fact, it's an isolated
system.

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.700
There's no energy or
matter that can go

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.990
through that boundary.

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:37.180
Yet, the temperature goes up.

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:44.160
So, I can have a temperature
change which is an adiabatic

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.040
temperature change.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:52.460
Adiabatic means without heat.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.170
Or I could have a non-adiabatic,
I could take

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:59.420
the same temperature change, by
taking a flame, or a heat

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:04.110
source and heating
up my substance.

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:09.980
So, clearly q is going to
depend on the path.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.640
I'm going from T1 to T2, and
I have two ways to go here.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.030
One is non-adiabatic.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:21.630
One is adiabatic.

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:24.450
All right, now what we're going
to learn next time, and

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:28.870
Bob Field is going to teach the
lecture next time, is how

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:31.680
heat and work are related, and
how they're really the same

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.540
thing, and how they're related
through the first law, through

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.560
energy conservation.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.430
OK, I'll see you on
Wednesday then.
