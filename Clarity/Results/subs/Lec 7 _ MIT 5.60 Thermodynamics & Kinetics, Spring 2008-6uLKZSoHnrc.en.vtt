00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:25.720
PROFESSOR NELSON: Well, so last
time we did a little bit

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.810
more work on thermodynamic
cycles, and basically went

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.420
around a cycle and looked at
some state functions, delta u

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.910
and delta H. Saw that around
a closed cycle those zero

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.940
because they're state
functions.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.530
So if you start and end at the
same place, they've got end at

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.860
the same place that
they started.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.870
There's no change in them, and
then we also looked at some at

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.020
non-state functions, work and
heat, and saw that those

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.720
aren't zero going
around a cycle.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.030
Of course you can do work in a
cyclic process, and heat can

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.200
be exchanged with the
environment at the same time.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.040
So we calculated those
values too.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.770
And we also looked at this other
funny function that's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.590
our special function.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.070
We looked at this integral dq
over T. It's so special that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.170
we called this derivative dS,
and saw that at least for the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.960
cycle we looked at, it
also behaved as a

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.840
state function behaves.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.120
That is, going around the cycle,
it had no net change,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.210
and we'll see this come
back later on.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.540
Then we went on to look at
thermochemistry, and that's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.220
what I want to continue today.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:44.020
So really, the main result that
we saw last time is that

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:52.990
we can describe the enthalpy
of reaction, so if we have

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:04.750
reactants going to products, and
we'd like to know our heat

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.800
of reaction or enthalpy of
reaction, remember it's a

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.540
constant pressure as we're
considering it, so it's

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.690
equivalent to heat of reaction,
than the way we can

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.840
do this is construct a cycle
where we're going to express

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.230
these in terms of their
constituent elements.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.810
We're going to all the way
back to the atoms.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.430
Right, so if we have the
elements in their standard

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.310
states, that is their most
stable forms at room

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:46.600
temperature and pressure, then
what we're really doing is

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.900
we're saying let's take the
reactants and let's pull them

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.110
all apart into their
separate elements,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.490
they're separate atoms.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.200
And then put them back together
this way, and we'll

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.440
calculate the enthalpy
of this process, the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.670
enthalpy of this process.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.090
It's a cycle, so that'll
give us the enthalpy of

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.300
reaction, all right?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:16.390
So this delta H is our sum for
delta H of formation for the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.440
reactants, right.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.580
And this is our sum of
the quantity for

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.350
the products, right.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.850
And in this way, then we can
express our delta H of

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:43.970
reaction is just going to be
given a sum of the heats of

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.140
formation or the difference
between the heats of formation

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.320
of the products and the
reactants, right?

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.210
Now, of course, we have to
weight this by the number of

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.330
moles of each reactant
to each product

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.840
involved in the reaction.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.720
So to write this a little more
carefully, it's, you want to

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:09.700
write the sum over i of nu i
delta H naught of formation of

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:17.200
i summed over the products.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:25.040
This is per mole minus sum over
i, nu i here over the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.940
reactants in the
same quantity.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.070
Delta H per mole f i, right?

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.830
So in other words, were taking
each of the products and we're

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.470
going to weight them by their
stoichiomeric coefficients,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.660
and we're going to have in this
delta H of reaction their

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.490
heats of formation, and then
we're going to have the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.950
negative heats of formation of
the reactants, because that's

00:04:50.950 --> 00:05:07.950
being subtracted, okay?

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.320
So, just to go through a basic
example, let's just look at

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:19.240
the burning of methane.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.440
So we've got methane gas,
combining with oxygen gas, so

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:36.070
you have carbon dioxide gas and
liquid water, and we'll

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.260
consider the whole thing
at room temperature

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.810
and pressure, right.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.690
So let's just undertake
this set of processes.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.460
Let's decompose these
to the elements.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.820
So in other words, our methane
gas, we're going to write the

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.540
chemical equilibrium between
this and the solid carbon.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.890
That is to say let's specify
graphite, it's not diamond,

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.390
right, graphite is the stable
form of carbon at room

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:15.260
temperature and pressure.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:22.460
And then, hydrogen gas two
moles of hydrogen gas and

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.100
we're going to have a delta
H of formation.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:34.000
This is for CH4 in the
gas phase, right?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:46.990
And then over here, we have our
oxygen but 2 O2 gas going

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:53.840
to, well 2 O2 gas -- the point
is oxygen already is in it's

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.820
stable form at room temperature

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.760
and pressure, right?

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.500
That is the elemental form of
oxygen, of course, is as

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:08.770
oxygen molecules in the gas so
there's no delta H formation

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.200
for oxygen.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.260
The gas is zero, right.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.160
And then second phase of this,
now we're going to take the

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.810
elements that we've produced,
and we're going to put them

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.320
back to make products, right?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:36.380
So there we've got carbon as
graphite, and a solid plus an

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:43.600
oxygen gas goes to make
CO2 gas, right.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.450
And we've got our positive
delta H of formation

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:52.140
associated with that.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:08:03.580
And finally we've got hydrogen
gas plus oxygen gas giving us

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.180
two water molecules and this
is in the liquid phase, and

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.140
there's some delta heat of
formation associated with

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:19.260
that, okay.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.030
So there is our set of
individual processes that's

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.690
going to constitute
our cycle, right.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.150
If we take the combination of
all those, which is to say we

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.910
just take both steps in this
cycle, then we'll have our net

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.790
reaction, which is to say
we'll have this, right.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:43.890
So what that says is our heat
of reaction is our heat of

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:53.340
formation per mole of
CO2 gas, right.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:09:00.410
Plus 2 times the heat of
reaction or heat of formation

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:14.790
per mole of liquid water minus
heat of formation per mole of

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.880
methane, right.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.430
And things we can
easily look up.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.220
So in a simple way, we can
determine, we can calculate

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.520
what the heat of
reaction is for

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.530
something like this, right.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.900
And you'll see in the back
of your book, you'll see

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.260
moderately extensive tables of
heats of formation, and if you

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.690
go online you'll see, you can
find extremely extensive

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.840
tabulated values of heats of
formation, that have been

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.160
measured for an enormous
number of compounds.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.510
And from that, then you can look
at enthalpies of reaction

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.050
for countless numbers
of reactions, right.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.140
So by using the tabulated data,
we can really determined

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.970
heats of formation for most
reactions that you might

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:04.070
contemplate, OK?

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:09.500
Of course, the cyclic steps that
we've taken to do this

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.580
apply not just for breaking
down reactants and product

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.580
into the elements in their
standards states, but of

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.600
course we could also look at
whole sets of reactions and

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.580
write cycles as well, right.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.900
So for example, if we wanted
to look at the reaction of

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:38.190
something like carbon graphite
plus oxygen gas to make carbon

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.620
monoxide gas, well normally
this isn't the way the

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.700
reaction would work.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.810
Normally if you just tried to
make this happen what you

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:52.580
would wind up with the
CO2, not CO, right.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.860
But one way to approach this
is you could look at the

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.710
individual reactions of going,
you could go to CO2 and then

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:05.240
you can go with CO2 and oxygen
and combine, or combine CO and

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.630
oxygen to get CO2, right?

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:17.630
So normally, CO2 is formed, but
you could calculate the

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.330
heat of reaction.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.470
Of course you could go back to
the elements, but you can also

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.080
say well, let's just take a
known heat of reaction for, or

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.390
heat of formation for CO2, and
then also combine that with

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.890
the heat of reaction for CO plus
oxygen forming CO2 and

00:11:33.890 --> 00:12:04.640
determine this that way, all
right, OK, so once you have

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.860
done this, once we've got the
heat of reaction then there

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.050
are a few simple results
that are useful.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.370
One is we know immediately
whether when we run a reaction

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.890
heat is going to be released
in the process out to the

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.660
environment, or whether
heat is going to

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.950
be taken in, right.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.220
So, and of course if you ever
used a hot pack or a chemical

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.180
hot pack or cold pack, you've
seen examples of the two of

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.250
those, where the constituents
are selected to give you

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.850
either heat released or
heat taken up, right.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:42.930
So in particular delta H of
reaction less than zero, that

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.580
means a negative amount of heat,
which means that heat is

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:56.270
released, right.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:08.230
Yes, that is it's exothermic.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:13.720
Positive enthalpy of reaction,
which is to say a heat of

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.270
reaction is positive.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.630
Remember the way we define heat
is positive it means that

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.540
there is heat that is coming
from the environment into the

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.320
system, right.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:31.010
In other words heat is absorbed
or taken up by the

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:39.870
reacting system.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:47.320
That's endothermic, okay.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.200
All right, one more important
aspect of this that we need to

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.670
be able to deal with, and that
is the heats of formation that

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.350
you'll find tabulated typically
are going to be

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.210
given for room temperature
and pressure.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.080
And it's very common that you
might want to know the

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.480
thermodynamic condition for
reactions, especially at other

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.750
temperatures, very common,
of course.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.960
And it's not hard to see how the
heat of reaction at room

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.420
temperature can be related to
they heat of reaction at other

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.470
temperatures.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:31.830
So let's just look at that.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:38.700
So remember your fundamental
relation, dH, if you write

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.460
that as a function of
temperature and pressure,

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:48.990
partial of H with respect to T,
constant pressure, dT, plus

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:54.850
partial of H with respect to p
at constant temperature, dp.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.690
But if we're working
at constant

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:02.750
pressure then dp is zero.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.680
So we just got the derivative
with respect to temperature.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:14.890
That's our heat capacity,
right, Cp.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.880
And we may have tabulated values
of Cp for an enormous

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.240
number of materials.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.530
So now, if we look at the
temperature dependence of

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.240
delta H for reaction, really
what we're going to need to do

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.540
is look at how that heat
capacity changes going from

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.850
reactants to products, right?

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:45.320
So in other words, d delta H of
reaction, with respect to

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:45.630
temperature.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.860
That's what we want to
find out, right?

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.830
So how does delta H change if
we change the temperature?

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:59.730
Well, it's just given by Cp dT
for the reactants and the

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.490
products, right?

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.680
For the products minus the
reaction, that is it's delta

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:15.350
Cp, we need the sum
over the products.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:26.940
Nu i, Cp i minus same
sum over reactants,

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:33.920
i, nu i Cp i, right.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.000
Similar to what we saw before.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.840
Now we need to integrate,
right.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:50.730
So if we integrate between some
pair of temperatures, T1

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:56.470
and T2, we do this and we have
this quantity, d delta H of

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:01.870
reaction with respect to
temperature, dT, all this is

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.950
at constant pressure, right.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:11.300
Let's just be careful
to specify that.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:21.710
Well, so of course, this is then
just delta H of reaction

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:27.430
at T2 minus delta H
of reaction at T1.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.380
This is looking good.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.890
This is what we want to get,
is our heat of reaction at

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.020
some new temperature T2.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.900
If we already know it at some
initial temperature, usually

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.150
room temperature, T1.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.720
And it's just given by the
integral from T1 to T2 of

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.510
delta Cp dT.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.400
Now in general, this is as far
as we can go, but at least if

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.810
the temperature change isn't
too big, for most materials

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.850
that heat capacities doesn't
depend very strongly on

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.920
temperature, right.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.270
If you take some material, and
you measure its heat capacity,

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.510
right, how much heat do I have
to put into it in order to

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.490
change its temperature
by a degree, right.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.120
And I make that measurement
at room temperature.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.530
And then maybe I raise the
temperature to whatever, room

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.780
temperature, maybe 20 degrees
hotter than room temperature.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.290
And I again say OK, now how much
heat do I need to raise

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.170
this thing's temperature
by 1 degree?

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.350
The amount of heat I need to put
in to do that is not very

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.210
different from what it was at
room temperature right.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.300
In other words the
heat capacity

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.780
didn't change very much.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:45.340
So, the result of that is
that at least for modest

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.250
temperature excursions, it may
be the case that we can

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.470
simplify this and simply say
it's just the difference in

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.870
heat capacities times the
temperature change.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.550
Again, we can't always be
assured of that, but it's

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:05.940
often the case.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:14.930
Any questions on any
of this so far?

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:19.030
OK, now what I want to do is
just describe a little bit of

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.070
how do you measure all
this stuff, right?

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.030
So what we've done so far is
just lay out in principle how

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.360
we should describe heats of
reaction, and of course

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.340
assuming that we've got
everything in tables we can

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.090
always look them up, but
sometimes you want to make new

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.740
compounds, right.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.400
Sometimes you'd like to know
what the energetics are

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.725
involved there, right, and so
it's useful to be able to

00:19:42.725 --> 00:19:46.710
actually measure something.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.130
So how do we do It?

00:19:48.130 --> 00:20:15.390
This is what's called
calorimetry.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:26.040
So we're going to make
measurements to determine heat

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.950
of reaction values.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.130
Actually, calorimetry is used
for all sorts of things.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.340
It can be used to determine, for
example, the energetics of

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.340
phase transitions.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.370
Maybe you're not looking at a
reaction, but you've got some

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.280
new compound, and you're looking
at it go from liquid

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.140
to solid or to gas.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.330
And you can see what the heat
involved in a process like

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.080
that is as well.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.000
So what happens?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:01.280
Well, the objective in the case
of a reaction, we have

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:09.210
reactants at some temperature
going to products at that

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:14.010
temperature, and that is our
heat of reaction at that

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:14.390
temperature.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.480
That's how it's defined,
right, at constant

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.940
temperature.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.640
OK?

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.720
What do we actually measure?

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.150
Well, what we can really do is
we can put the reactants in

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:37.270
some container, put the whole
thing in an insulated place,

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.310
you know, hold things in
a big insulated box.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.190
Run the reaction.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.620
Maybe it produces heat.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.810
If it does, then the whole thing
will heat up, right?

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:52.290
The stuff that's inside the
reacting volume, and

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.445
whatever's right around it there
inside the big box, it's

00:21:55.445 --> 00:21:56.990
all going to heat up.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.600
So I'll start at some initial
temperature, T1.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.170
I won't end up at the
same temperature.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:02.570
It'll be hotter.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:03.480
How much hotter?

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.740
Well, that depends on how
much heat was produced.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.640
So in principle, if I measure
how much hotter, I can

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.430
determine how much heat was
produced, and from that, I

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.670
should be able to calculate
delta H at T1.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:24.950
So let's think about how
that's really working.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:35.640
I've really got reactants at T1,
plus a calorimeter at T1,

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.650
and I'm going to end up with
products -- well let's let me

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:46.140
just write that's over.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.260
In fact, let's start by just
putting a little sketch of the

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.430
whole thing up.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:23:00.750
So here's my reacting stuff,
maybe it's a liquid.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.440
It's going to take
place in there.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.410
It's going to be a constant
pressure, it might be open to

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.960
the air, or even if it isn't,
there might be plenty of room,

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.280
and it's a liquid anyway, so
the pressure isn't going to

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.380
change significantly.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:18.490
I want to measure
the temperature.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.520
And the whole thing is
insulated right.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.300
I don't want to have to deal
with heat escaping to the

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.920
outside environment in a way
that might be difficult or

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.190
complicated to measure
or calculate.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.640
OK, so this, what I've sketched
here would be a

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.440
constant pressure calorimeter.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.360
There's a reaction.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.600
Normally this is used for a
reaction in the condensed

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.300
phases and liquid usually.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:58.620
So this is a constant pressure
calorimeter.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.020
It's set up to be

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.320
well-insulated so it's adiabatic.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.580
That's the set up.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.750
We're going to run the
reactants, the reaction.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.860
The reactants are going
to turn into products.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:31.420
Let's look at what happens.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:41.270
So what happens is my
reactants at T1 plus

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:52.460
calorimeter at T1 turn into
products at T2 plus my

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.030
calorimeter at T2, right.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:57.980
That's my process.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.180
That's what really happens.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.470
Now that, the enthalpy of that
process isn't what I want,

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.110
right, because the temperature
has changed, also the

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.360
calorimeter is heated up.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.850
So I need to relate this
to what I do want.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:17.520
Let's label this one.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.600
It is adiabatic.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.790
It is taking place inside this
thing, and it's a constant

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:29.420
pressure, and we'll do
it reversibly, right.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.850
So that's what we've got.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:39.010
Now, we can always take these
things the products and the

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.040
calorimeter at temperature T2
and cool them or warm them to

00:25:43.040 --> 00:26:07.480
get to products plus calorimeter
at T1, right.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.620
Let's label that two.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.650
It's still at constant
pressure.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.090
It's reversible.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.650
It's a temperature change.

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.100
Now to make that happen, it's
not adiabatic, right.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.750
If I wanted to do that, I'd
need a heating element or

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.370
something to cool, so I could
make that temperature change

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.870
happen, right.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.980
Well, so now I can complete
the cycle.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.490
I've got reactants and
calorimeter at T1.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.770
Fewer products and calorimeter
at T1, right.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.260
Calorimeter doesn't change
in this process.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:51.380
So here I've got some delta H
associated with changing the

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.360
temperature.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.690
This delta H though, this
is what I want.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:02.000
This is delta H of reaction
at T1, right?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:12.370
It's isothermal, constant
pressure, reversible.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.370
Just what I want.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:17.880
That's how I've defined
delta H of reaction.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.410
This is what I'm after.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:24.050
All right, so now let's see how
we execute it, and do the

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.690
calculations that allow
us to calculate this.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:43.840
So, one, what's delta
H in step one?

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:50.790
Yes, exactly, it's adiabatic,
right constant pressure.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:51.800
it's zero.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:58.980
Delta H1 is zero, right.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.940
What we're really going to do in
practice is we're going to

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.610
measure, we're going to use our
thermometer and say great,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.750
how much did the temperature
change, right.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.350
So now, then we're going to use
what we're going to learn

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:16.840
from step two in order to
calculate this part, what we

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.840
could call step three.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:29.040
OK, so two, that's
the crucial part.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.370
It's constant pressure.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:34.730
It's just given by the
corresponding heat, and it's

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.640
just a temperature
change, right.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:46.440
So we know how to do this,
integral from well it's T1 to

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:52.530
T2, depending on which way
we go of Cp for the

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:56.470
whole system dT.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:05.590
OK?

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:09.050
It's just how much heat is
involved when we change the

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:09.450
temperature.

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:13.370
Now, the products have some heat
capacity associated with

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.750
them right, it takes a certain
amount of heat if we make

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.060
their temperature change, to
either put it in or take it

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.030
away, depending on which
direction the

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.070
temperature is changing.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:29.050
Same with the calorimeter, OK.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:33.050
In actual practice though, the
calorimeter, is going to be

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.910
this big hunk of metal, and
really what's going to,

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.610
there's going to be some stuff
in here, right, they'll be a

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.390
fluid, it will usually
be some sort of oil.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:46.340
There's a pretty big
thermal mass.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.260
Now we run the reaction
and it produces heat.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:55.310
Most of the heat is going to
warm up or cool off all that

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.200
oil and stuff.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.390
There's a moderate amount
of material

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:00.570
in the actual reaction.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:04.180
You want to design the
calorimeter to fulfill that

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.100
condition,

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.560
Of course, you can't make it
so enormous that even for,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.310
that for any ordinary reaction
there's not even a measurable

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.310
temperature change, right,
because if you have your

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.860
enough oil to fill up this room,
it would take a huge

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.340
amount of heat to change it by
even a tiny, it's temperature

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.900
but even a tiny amount.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:25.200
So the calorimeter is designed
sort of to scale to match the

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.490
maybe the ordinary volume of
reactants that you'll put in

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:34.950
there, such that, pretty much
all the heat's just going to

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:39.430
heat up the calorimeter, and
there's only a small amount

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.510
that's going toward heating
up the products, right.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:49.510
So in general, or at least
usually it'll be the case,

00:30:49.510 --> 00:31:01.450
that this is approximately equal
to integral from T1 to

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:09.180
T2 Cp of just the
calorimeter dT.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:27.100
And that generally is just given
by the heat capacity the

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.220
calorimeter times
delta T, right..

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.620
Because the heat capacity of the
calorimeter just like this

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:41.170
thing is not strongly
temperature dependent, OK.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:44.950
So the point is we can calculate
delta H associated

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:52.280
with this process pretty
readily, OK.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:32:00.700
That leaves three, right.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:07.400
But delta H for step three must
just be the opposite of

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.930
this delta H because this was
zero and we know that were

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:23.910
going around a cycle, right.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:28.750
And that's our heat
of reaction.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:44.010
So we're going to be able
to do this, right?

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:50.120
OK, now this is one way to
do calorimetry, and it's

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.480
practical as long as all the
materials are in condensed

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.630
phases, solids and liquids.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:01.700
If gases are involved it can
work, but it can be tricky to

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.070
keep the pressure constant,
right, because that means that

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:10.290
now the moles of gas might be
changing, and that means in

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.670
some way the volume has
to be adjustable.

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.760
You'd need some sort of balloon
or membrane that will

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.910
allow that to happen.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.760
Could be done, but easier is to
just do the whole thing at

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.010
constant volume, right, and just
run the reaction that way

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:29.550
and redo the calculation to be
a constant volume rather than

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.200
constant pressure calorimeter,
right.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.950
And it's not hard to do that.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.240
So let's just look at what
happens in that case.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:34:02.150
It's almost the same.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:06.700
So let's see, just to finish the
job here though, all this

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.700
says is delta H of reaction is
just negative Cp for the

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:18.880
calorimeter times delta T, all
right. so that's what we think

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:29.780
we know in constant pressure
calorimetry.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:37.990
Yes, and if we have gases
involved, it's pretty similar,

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:41.910
but now what will have is
something like this.

00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:46.300
We'll have a reaction vessel
that's sealed,

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:51.280
it's constant volume.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.470
That'll be inside
our calorimeter.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:35:06.900
It's insulated, and there's
still a thermometer, so we can

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.170
measure the temperature.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:10.290
So this is still adiabatic.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:17.100
It's insulated, but now it's
constant volume, OK.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.060
Now, you know with constant
volume, now it's not going to

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.880
be delta H that's
straightforward to measure,

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.580
it's going to be dealt
u, all right.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.820
But it's going to be almost
the same, right?

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.900
So let's just think about
what happens here.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.480
Now it's the cycle that
we've got will still

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.780
basically look the same.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:44.980
That is its reactants at T1 plus
calorimeter at T1, going

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:54.310
to products at T2 plus
calorimeter at T2, right?

00:35:54.310 --> 00:36:04.560
And it's still adiabatic, but
now it's constant volume.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.690
And it's also reversal right.

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:14.990
So this is our process one.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:21.450
Now, process two, we're going
to end up here with our

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:29.100
products, again at T1 plus our
calorimeter at T1, right.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.520
So now we have a
constant volume

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:41.810
reversible temperature change.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:47.760
And so this part now isn't
exactly what we want to

00:36:47.760 --> 00:37:00.540
determine delta H, because it's
a isothermal constant

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:07.490
volume, reversible products or
reversible process that takes

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:11.170
a reactant to T1 to
a product of T1.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.440
What these are going to give
us are delta u values.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:20.810
This'll give us delta u of
reaction, right, T1, right.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:25.070
It's a constant volume.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.190
All right, so in the end, we're
going to determine delta

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.910
u here, and then in the end,
we're going to have to relate

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.790
that to delta H, but that's
straight forward enough to do.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:38.060
So let's look at how we'll
analyze what happens.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:48.850
So one adiabatic, constant
volume process, right.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:51.290
What's zero in that case?

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:53.260
In this case delta
H was zero in the

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.170
constant pressure example.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.790
Now we've got a constant
volume process.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:03.410
What's zero?

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:07.880
It's u, because u is to q plus
w right, heat and work, but

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.250
it's adiabatic.

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:14.050
So there's no heat, exchange
with the environment, and it's

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:20.020
constant volume, so there's
no p dV work, right.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:29.320
So q is zero adiabatic.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:35.000
Work is zero.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.850
Delta u1 is zero.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:45.390
And again just in the constant
pressure case, what happens

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:49.960
that we're going to measure in
step one, which is to say in

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.650
actually running the
reaction is the

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:54.480
temperature's going to change.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:54.960
Right?

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.200
The whole thing's going to come
to some new equilibrium

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.250
temperature between the products
and the oil or

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:04.480
whatever's around it, and we're
going to measure that.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:13.540
OK, two, now it's a temperature
change, right?

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:17.490
We know how to calculate delta
u for a temperature change.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.420
It's very similar here, but
what's going to be different

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:28.870
from the case with constant
pressure?

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:32.470
There's a real important detail
that's different if you

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.790
want to calculate what happens
at constant pressure when you

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:36.980
change the temperature?

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:40.220
What happens at constant
volume?

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:45.000
Looking at this expression,
what's got to be different?

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:45.800
Cv, right.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.240
We're not going to have the
constant pressure heat

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.860
capacity, we're going to have
the constant volume heat

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.620
capacity, right.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:57.800
So delta u for step two, that's
our q under constant

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:05.760
volume conditions, integral
from T1 to T2 Cv for our

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.030
whole system dT.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:19.030
Integral from T2 to T2, and now
I can separate again the

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:24.930
calorimeter from the product,
and at least approximately,

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:34.400
again, it'll be Cv for the
calorimeter dT, which is to

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.700
say then it's Cv of
the calorimeter

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:50.290
times delta T. Great.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:55.310
Three, well delta u1 was zero.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:41:03.910
Delta u2 was there Cv delta T,
so now all we need since the

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:07.820
whole thing is going around in
a cycle, Since we know delta

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:17.410
u3 must be negative delta u2,
and that is our delta u of

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:46.560
reaction, right?

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.800
So delta u of reaction is
approximately equal to

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:59.500
negative Cv for the calorimeter
times delta T. So,

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:07.530
this is what we're going to
measure, and this is what

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.490
we're going to determine.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:13.100
And now we're almost done,
except what we really want is

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:18.530
delta H and not delta
V, right.

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:25.320
So now we're going to use the
fact that H is u plus pV.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:38.770
Delta H is delta u plus delta
pV, and now this is all at

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.570
constant temperature
in the end, right?

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:46.180
We've determined delta u for
some temperature T1, right.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.210
So what happens then
we're going to use

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:52.000
the ideal gas law.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.270
So it's approximately delta
u plus delta nRT.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.440
That's a constant.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.300
That's a constant.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:10.050
So it's delta u plus RT, we can
say T1 is the temperature

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:15.060
we've used here, delta
n of the gas.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:18.620
In other words, what matters
here in changing the pressure

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.730
volume product?

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:23.050
What matters is we turned some
reactants into some products.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:26.000
How many moles of gas are
there in each case, in

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.180
reactants and products?

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.840
If that changes, of course you
know that the pressure in

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.850
there is going to change at
constant volume if the amount

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.940
of gas in there is changing.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.840
And nothing else is going
to make a significant

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:46.560
contribution to it, OK?

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:53.720
So finally, then delta H of
reaction for our temperature

00:43:53.720 --> 00:44:00.750
T1 is approximately minus Cv of
the calorimeter times delta

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:07.680
T plus R T1 delta n of gas.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.450
Change of the number of
moles of gas, right.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:17.400
We're going to measure that,
and now we're going to

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.850
determine this.

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:25.630
In practice, we'll already know
the heat capacity of our

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.520
calorimeter, when we
buy it, right?

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.730
So we don't really need to put
in a certain amount of heat

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.530
and change the temperature
of the products and the

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.740
calorimeter and so on.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.450
What we need to do is just
measure how much the

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:45.370
temperature changed, OK.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:48.640
It's worth getting just sort of
roughly calibrated how big

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.130
is this compared to the
rest of this stuff.

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:55.950
That is, how different
is delta u from

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.120
delta H, all right.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.250
And of course it's
straightforward to do this,

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.930
and I've written this out in the
notes, so I won't re-write

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:05.030
the numbers here.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:09.490
But I gave an example
looking at combining

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:11.690
HCl and oxygen right.

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:18.150
So 4 HCl plus oxygen gas.

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:26.730
This two in the gas going to
water and the liquid, plus

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:30.160
chlorine gas at room
temperature.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:38.020
Well, what you find out is delta
u of reaction is minus

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:43.960
195 kilojoules for the
reaction as written.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.090
And it turns out, as written, if
you say OK, how much, what

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:49.100
changed for the pV product?

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:52.720
Well here we've got four moles
of gas, five moles of gas.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.880
Here just two, so we changed
the number of

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.600
moles of gas by three.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.080
All right, how much did
it matter, right?

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.010
Well it matters.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:03.130
It's measurable.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:09.330
So now delta H of reaction
turns out to be minus 202

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.540
kilojoules.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.815
So, you know, seven out of a
couple of a hundred, right, a

00:46:15.815 --> 00:46:18.810
few percent, kind of typical.

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.920
In other words, if you look
at energetics of ordinary

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.480
reactions where you're, you
know, you're making and

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.045
breaking covalent bonds, there's
a fair amount of

00:46:26.045 --> 00:46:28.660
energy stored in those, right?

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:33.860
The additional change due to
changing pressure volume is

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:34.960
certainly measurable.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.510
You don't want to just ignore
it, but in cases like that,

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:40.310
it's usually a small fraction
of the total.

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:47.560
A few percent is
typical, okay.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:54.190
All right, let me just go
through one numerical example

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:58.510
of a calorimetry calculation,
OK.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:02.070
I won't put all the numbers up
on the board because our time

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.470
is running short, but I just
want to outline it.

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:08.870
All I really want to do is
calibrate you a little bit for

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:13.760
what happens with ordinary
calorimeter heat capacities

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.740
that makes the calculation
turn out to be relatively

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.240
easy, right.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.580
So let's just write it out.

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:30.590
Let's take iron sulfide as a
solid, plus 11 halves oxygen

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:40.240
gas to make iron oxide,
also a solid, plus

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.820
sulphur dioxide gas.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:46.460
All right.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:53.060
We'll start at T1
is 298 Kelvin.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:59.460
T2, maybe we don't know
it yet, right.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:11.740
OK, so we know how to calculate
what's going to

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.320
happen, delta H and delta u,
because we can look up the

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.400
heats of formation and
so forth of all

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.080
the compounds, right.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:26.200
So if we do that, what we
discover is that delta H of

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.320
formation whoops, something's
wrong here.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:35.390
This is sulphur -- what am I
doing, boy, S and it's a two,

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:40.040
sorry, and the heat of formation
is minus 180

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:47.600
kilojoules per mole, that's
oxygen, it's zero.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.020
Boy, I'm, I don't know what is
about this reaction that's

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.980
vexing me but it's not
that complicated.

00:48:53.980 --> 00:49:00.840
Here it's minus 824 kilojoules
per mole minus 297 kilojoules

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:01.920
per mole, right.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:07.340
So that's our input
thermodynamic data.

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:16.030
So first of all, let's just
do a heat of reaction

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.950
calculation, right.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:20.930
Taking the product minus
the reaction, right.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:29.890
So it's minus 824 plus 4
times minus 297 minus

00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:33.450
2 times minus 180.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:34.120
Right?

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.540
In other words I've got the
stoichiometric coefficients in

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.840
there and the values, and I'm
subtracting the reactants from

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:49.370
products wind up with minus
1652 kilojoules per mole.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:52.440
Well, it depends on what we
write, what we consider mole,

00:49:52.440 --> 00:50:04.150
right, maybe I should just write
kilojoules as written.

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:16.010
OK, I'm going to skip the delta
and get the change in

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.055
moles of gas calculation.

00:50:18.055 --> 00:50:19.530
It's straightforward to do.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.680
What I really want to do is just
give an example of what

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.900
happens when you throw the
thing, the material into a

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.930
calorimeter and see how much
the temperature changes.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:38.340
So let's imagine we start with
0.1 moles of our iron sulfide,

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.250
and then we have a
stoichiometric amount of

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:43.200
oxygen, and the whole thing is
done in a constant volume

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.010
calorimeter, and we
see what happens.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.870
Now the crucial element is what
is the heat capacity of

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:49.930
the calorimeter, right?

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:53.320
And it's, again it's a
macroscopic pretty big thing,

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:58.540
so typical might be 10
kilojoules per Kelvin, and

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.820
that's pretty big, right?

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.880
Noticed that's not
per mole, right.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.820
I mean the calorimeter is a big
thing filled the little

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.370
oil or whatever is
inside it, right?

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.180
And it's for that whole
unit that you've

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.400
got some heat capacity.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.780
How much heat does it take the
warm the entire thing up or

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:18.140
the insides of the thing
up by a degree?

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.480
It's that number right.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.230
Ordinary heat capacities are
in Joule's per Kelvin mole,

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:25.690
not kilojoules, right.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.865
And what that's telling you is
probably your reactants and

00:51:28.865 --> 00:51:30.850
products, so the amount of
heat that's involved in

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:32.820
changing the air temperature
is going to be negligible

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:36.610
compared to what happens to
the whole calorimeter.

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:39.530
OK?

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:46.000
So now if we say, OK, we we've
done this calculation starting

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.980
with 2 moles of this, but now
we're going to be at 0.1 mole,

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.830
so we're going to need to
divide by 20, right.

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:57.950
So instead of minus 1652, it's
going to turn out delta u is

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:07.980
minus 1648 kilojoules, so, and
then divide by twenty, we end

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:17.250
up with minus 82.4 kilojoules,
that is, that's the delta u of

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:21.620
reaction for what happens if
you'd put in not two moles of

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:24.400
this, but 0.1 mole
of this, right.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.860
Practical amounts is the reason
I'm using numbers like

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.970
this, right.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:32.050
So now, what's delta T?

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:41.060
Well here's Cv, right, so delta
T is just our minus 10

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:50.640
kilojoules per degree oh sorry,
it's our minus 82.4

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:59.930
kilojoules.

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:06.280
That's the heat released,
divided by minus 10 or 10

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:11.630
kilojoules per Kelvin, right.

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:14.070
It's 8.2 Kelvin.

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:18.450
In other words, how much does
the temperature of the whole

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:21.060
thing change when you put an
ordinary amount of material in

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.940
there and run a reaction,
right.

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:23.620
Well, what do you do?

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.300
You calculate how much heat is
released in the reaction.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.800
And then what's going to matter
is what's the heat

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.420
capacity of the whole,
of the calorimeter?

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.750
I didn't even need to know
that heat capacity of the

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:38.100
product, right.

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:42.110
Because it's effect the thermal
mass of the product is

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:44.080
negligible compared to the
thermal mass of the

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.200
calorimeter.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:50.650
Now in real practice, I'll do
the calculation in reverse.

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:53.870
I'll measure how much the
temperature changed in the

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:56.040
calorimeter, right.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.740
I'll know the heat capacity,
and what I'll really be

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:02.440
calculating is OK, how much heat
must have been released

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:06.080
in the reaction to make that
temperature change happen?

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.100
And that in the case of constant
volume, in this case

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:12.305
that's my delta u, and then
I'll add my little delta n

00:54:12.305 --> 00:54:16.360
term to get delta H.

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:20.260
Any questions on calorimetry?

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:20.950
OK.

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:21.710
See you Friday.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:26.670
We'll finish on calorimetry and
thermochemistry and then

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:30.670
we'll start in on one of the
really most difficult topics

00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:33.020
that we'll deal with all
semester, which is a second

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:36.550
law and our special function
that we've seen just a little

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:38.110
bit so far.
